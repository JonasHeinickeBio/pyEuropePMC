# Python Version Compatibility Strategy

## Current Status Analysis

### Supported Python Ecosystem (June 2025)

- **Python 3.10**: Released Oct 2021, **Active support until Oct 2026**
- **Python 3.11**: Released Oct 2022, Active support until Oct 2027
- **Python 3.12**: Released Oct 2023, Active support until Oct 2028
- **Python 3.13**: Released Oct 2024, Active support until Oct 2029

### Recommended Strategy: **3.10+ with Strategic Testing**

## 1. Version Support Policy

### Primary Support (Full Testing)

- **Python 3.10** - Minimum version, guaranteed compatibility
- **Python 3.12** - Recommended version for performance

### Secondary Support (Compatibility Testing)

- **Python 3.11** - Should work but not primary focus
- **Python 3.13** - Future-proofing, test when stable

### Rationale

- **3.10+** covers 95%+ of active Python installations in scientific computing
- **Skip 3.9** - End of life Oct 2025, security updates only
- **Focus resources** on versions that matter most to users

## 2. Multi-Version CI/CD Strategy

### GitHub Actions Matrix Testing

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ["3.10", "3.12"]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
  fail-fast: false
```

### Testing Tiers

1. **Core Tests** (All versions): Import, basic functionality
2. **Integration Tests** (Primary versions): Full API testing
3. **Performance Tests** (Latest version): Benchmarking

## 3. Dependency Compatibility Matrix

### Critical Dependencies

- `requests`: Supports 3.7+ (✅ Compatible)
- `backoff`: Supports 3.6+ (✅ Compatible)
- `defusedxml`: Supports 3.6+ (✅ Compatible)
- `typing-extensions`: Supports 3.7+ (✅ Compatible)

### Development Dependencies

- `pytest`: Supports 3.8+ (✅ Compatible)
- `mypy`: Supports 3.8+ (✅ Compatible)
- `ruff`: Supports 3.7+ (✅ Compatible)

## 4. Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing Levels

#### Level 1: Syntax & Import Testing

- Verify code parses on all supported versions
- Test all imports succeed
- Check basic instantiation

#### Level 2: Unit Testing

- Run full test suite on primary versions (3.10, 3.12)
- Focus on core functionality
- Test edge cases and error handling

#### Level 3: Integration Testing

- Test against real Europe PMC API
- Verify network operations
- Test large data handling

#### Level 4: Performance Testing

- Benchmark on latest Python version
- Memory usage analysis
- Regression testing

## 5. Version-Specific Considerations

### Python 3.10 (Minimum)

- **Benefits**: Stable, widely adopted, pattern matching
- **Focus**: Ensure all features work reliably
- **Testing**: Full test suite, all features

### Python 3.12 (Recommended)

- **Benefits**: 15% performance improvement, better error messages
- **Focus**: Performance validation, future features
- **Testing**: Full suite + performance benchmarks

### Python 3.13+ (Future)

- **Benefits**: Free-threaded Python (experimental), improved REPL
- **Focus**: Compatibility testing, no feature development yet
- **Testing**: Basic compatibility only

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- [x] Update pyproject.toml to support 3.10+
- [ ] Create comprehensive CI/CD matrix
- [ ] Add version-specific testing

### Phase 2: Professional Testing

- [ ] Implement multi-version GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add compatibility testing framework
- [ ] Create version support documentation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Performance benchmarking across versions
- [ ] Automated compatibility reporting
- [ ] Version-specific optimizations

## 7. Quality Gates

### Required for Release

- ✅ All tests pass on Python 3.10
- ✅ All tests pass on Python 3.12
- ✅ Import tests pass on all supported versions
- ✅ No deprecation warnings on any version

### Recommended for Release

- ✅ Performance benchmarks within 5% on 3.12 vs 3.10
- ✅ Memory usage stable across versions
- ✅ Full integration tests pass

## 8. User Communication

### Documentation Strategy

- Clearly state minimum version (3.10+)
- Recommend Python 3.12 for best performance
- Provide migration guide for users on older versions
- Document version-specific benefits

### Support Policy

- **Full Support**: Python 3.10
- **Best Effort**: Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **No Support**: Python 3.9 and below

This strategy balances thorough testing with practical resource allocation.
