# Steps to Make Generated Models Pre-commit Conform

The file `src/pyeuropepmc/models/generated.py` is auto-generated by LinkML and may not pass pre-commit hooks due to linting and type checking issues.

## Automated Fix

Run the post-processing script after generating the models:

```bash
python scripts/fix_generated_models.py src/pyeuropepmc/models/generated.py
```

This script will:
1. Wrap long docstrings (>99 characters) in class docstrings.
2. Add `@classmethod` decorators and type annotations to `@field_validator` methods.

## Manual Steps (if needed)

If the script doesn't cover everything:

1. **Wrap long docstrings**: Ensure no line in class docstrings exceeds 99 characters. Wrap at natural breaks.

2. **Fix field validators**: Add `@classmethod` above each `@field_validator`, and annotate the method as `def pattern_name(cls, v: Any) -> Any:`.

## One-time Setup

- **Mypy override**: Already configured in `pyproject.toml` to ignore errors in `pyeuropepmc.models.generated`.

- **Poetry lock**: If dependencies change, run `poetry lock` to update the lock file.

## Verification

After fixes, run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Ensure all hooks pass (ruff, mypy, bandit, etc.).
