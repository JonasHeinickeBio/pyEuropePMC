### Description
It would be beneficial to add functionality for parsing full text XML files into different output formats. This feature could include:
- Extracting metadata
- Converting the content to Markdown or plaintext
- Extracting tables
- Other possible outputs useful for downstream applications

### Potential Use Cases
- Facilitating content reuse in different formats
- Streamlining data extraction processes
- Enhancing compatibility with various tools and workflows

### Suggested Approach
- Leverage existing XML parsing libraries to handle the full text XML
- Implement modular functions for each output type
- Ensure robust error handling and logging

### Additional Notes
Any additional suggestions or discussions on this would be appreciated.
