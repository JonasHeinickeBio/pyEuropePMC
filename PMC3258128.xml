In this study, we employed 3&#x02032;-end biotinylated synthetic miR-122 to identify its targets based on affinity purification. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the affinity purified RNAs demonstrated a specific enrichment of several known miR-122 targets such as CAT-1 (also called SLC7A1), ADAM17 and BCL-w. Using microarray analysis of affinity purified RNAs, we also discovered many candidate target genes of miR-122. Among these candidates, we confirmed that protein kinase, interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent activator (PRKRA), a Dicer-interacting protein, is a direct target gene of miR-122. miRNA quantitative-RT&#x02013;PCR results indicated that miR-122 and small interfering RNA against PRKRA may facilitate the accumulation of newly synthesized miRNAs but did not detectably affect endogenous miRNAs levels. Our findings will lead to further understanding of multiple functions of this hepato-specific miRNA. We conclude that miR-122 could repress PRKRA expression and facilitate accumulation of newly synthesized miRNAs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small conserved RNAs of &#x0223c;22&#x02009;nt which negatively modulate gene expression in animals and plants, primarily through base paring to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). This leads to mRNA cleavage and/or translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B1">1</xref>). miRNAs are primarily transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an &#x0223c;70-nt stem&#x02013;loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA. The mature miRNA is incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that each miRNA may regulate hundreds of target genes, suggesting that miRNAs may play a role in almost every biological pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B2">2</xref>). Indeed, miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B3 gkr715-B4 gkr715-B5 gkr715-B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>).</p><p>One of the first clues of the existence of miRNAs in mammals came from studies on genetic alterations in woodchuck liver tumors. In 1989, a gene rearrangement of c-myc and an unusual transcript, named <italic>hcr</italic>, was described in one of these tumors. This transcript was characterized as liver specific, essentially non-coding, specifically nuclear and processed by endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B7">7</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>hcr</italic> was proposed to be the precursor for miR-122. In the current understanding, the part of the <italic>hcr</italic> transcript encompassing the so-called &#x02018;pri-miRNA&#x02019; is predicted to be processed to form a 66-nt long &#x02018;pre-miRNA&#x02019;, which presents a hairpin structure with 79% base pairing, and which will ultimately be cleaved by the endonuclease Dicer to form the mature miR-122 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B8">8</xref>). Recent works on tissue-specific miRNAs has demonstrated miRNAs participation in tissue specification and cell lineage decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B9 gkr715-B10 gkr715-B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). Among these tissue-specific miRNAs, miR-122 is one which is specifically expressed in adult liver and constitutes 70% of the total miRNA population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B12 gkr715-B13 gkr715-B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Recent studies showed that miR-122 could modulate lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B16">16</xref>), hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B17 gkr715-B18 gkr715-B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B20">20</xref>) and play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B21 gkr715-B22 gkr715-B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). To better understand the role of this liver-specific miRNA, the identification of the target genes of miR-122 is necessary.</p><p>In the present study, we employed 3&#x02032;-end biotinylated synthetic miR-122 to identify its target genes based on affinity purification as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B25">25</xref>). Quantitative reverse transcriptase&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) analysis of the affinity purified RNAs demonstrated a specific enrichment of several reported miR-122 targets, such as CAT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B13">13</xref>), ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B22">22</xref>) and BCL-w (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B20">20</xref>). By microarray, many candidate target genes of miR-122 were identified. We also verified that PRKRA, which showed a high of enrichment in affinity purification assay, was a new target gene of miR-122. Furthermore, the over-expression of miR-122 could facilitate the accumulation of newly synthesized miRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cultures</title><p>HepG2 and HeLa cell lines were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% FBS with 100&#x02009;U/ml penicillin and 100&#x02009;mg/ml streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Affinity purification experiments</title><p>To identify mRNAs associated with miRNA-122, affinity purification experiments were performed as described previously (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr715/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr715/DC1">Supplementary Methods</ext-link> for details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B25">25</xref>).

PRKRA is a human cellular protein that heterodimerizes with PKR through its double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and activates PKR pathway <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of dsRNA. In contrast to PRKRA, the human immunodeficiency virus transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP), another dsRBD protein with 42% identity to PRKRA, has an inhibitory effect on PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B31">31</xref>). The opposite effects of PRKRA and TRBP on PKR activity are mediated by the C-terminal dsRBDs, which are devoid of detectable dsRNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B31">31</xref>). PRKRA and TRBP have been demonstrated recently to interact with RNase III Dicer, a key enzyme involving in miRNA maturation, through their C-terminal dsRBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B32 gkr715-B33 gkr715-B34 gkr715-B35">32&#x02013;35</xref>).

This supports the previous observation that mature miRNA is highly stable in cells and therefore the changes in the steady-state level of mature miRNA may be difficult to detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B36 gkr715-B37 gkr715-B38">36&#x02013;38</xref>).

Results from miRNA-RT&#x02013;qPCR indicated that miR-122 duplex, siPRKRA-1 and siPRKRA-2 could facilitate accumulation of newly synthesized miR-133 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr715-F4">Figure 4</xref>C). We also found that PRKRA siRNAs could also facilitate accumulation of newly synthesized miR-122 when HeLa cells were cotransfected with miR-122 expressing vector (pcDNA3.0-miR122) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr715-F4">Figure 4</xref>D).

It is also shown that PRKRA is negatively regulated by miR-122 via a specific target site within the 3&#x02032;-UTR. Moreover, we showed that miR-122 facilitates accumulation of newly synthesized miRNA through downregulating PRKRA expression. The identification of miR-122 as an important regulator of miRNA maturation emphasizes an essential role of this liver-specific miRNA.</p><p>Sophisticated mechanisms regulating RNA may explain the gap between the great complexity of cellular functions and the limited number of primary transcripts. Regulation by miRNAs underscores this possibility, as each miRNA is believed to bind directly to many mRNAs to regulate their translation or stability and thereby control a wide range of activities. Despite their biological importance, determining the targets of miRNAs is a major challenge. Attention has largely been laid on computational predictions of targets based on the observation that many miRNAs can recognize their targets by binding to motifs in the 3&#x02032;-UTR sequences complementary to bases 2&#x02013;8 of the miRNA (the seed region) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B41">41</xref>). Whereas these algorithms have been instrumental in many studies of individual miRNA:mRNA interactions, unbiased approaches to study miRNA target recognition are important to discover new features of miRNAs. In this study, we used a direct affinity-based procedure to isolate target mRNAs bound by miR-122. These results will help us to understand the function of this liver-specific miRNA. While preparing this manuscript one group has published a paper demonstrating miR-122 targeting CUTL1 (CUX1) during liver development, which is also enriched by biotin-tagged miR-122 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr715/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B42">42</xref>).</p><p>The affinity-based target-identification procedure was performed following Orom <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B25">25</xref>) with some modification. The non-specific binding of RNAs to streptavidin&#x02013;agarose beads was unavoidable even we washed the beads four times with cell lysis buffer. Therefore, GAPDH with no putative target site of miR-122 was chosen to serve as an internal control. If one gene is the target of miR-122, the output would contain more mRNA/GAPDH than the Input. To validate our results, we also normalize mRNA with &#x003b2;-actin (no putative target site of miR-122 in its 3&#x02032;-UTR). Results from real-time PCR showed that miR-122's known target gene had enrichment in Ouput when normalized to GAPDH or &#x003b2;-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr715-F1">Figure 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr715/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>).</p><p>miRNAs are generated by a two-step processing pathway. Primary miRNAs are processed to pre-miRNAs by Drosha. These pre-miRNAs are cleaved by Dicer to generate mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B43 gkr715-B44 gkr715-B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). In human cells, Drosha exists as part of a protein complex called the Microprocessor complex, which contains the dsRNA-binding protein DGCR8 (also called Pasha). DGCR8 is essential for Drosha activity and capable of binding single-stranded fragments of the pri-miRNA that are required for proper processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B47">47</xref>). Dicer also exists as part of a protein complex which contains two dsRNA-binding proteins, TRBP and PRKRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B32 gkr715-B33 gkr715-B34 gkr715-B35">32&#x02013;35</xref>). It was reported that TRBP knockdown reduced endogenous miRNA levels in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B32">32</xref>). Here, we found that PRKRA knockdown by miR-122 duplex or siRNAs against PRKRA could facilitate accumulation of newly synthesized miRNA. Thus dsRNA-binding protein such as DGCR8, TRBP and PRKRA could affect the miRNAs processing pathway by interacting with Drosha or Dicer.</p><p>However, our finding that PRKRA is a negative regulator of miRNA processing is in direct conflict with the finding of Lee <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B34">34</xref>). They demonstrated that the reduction of PRKRA protein results in reduced miRNA accumulation. The contradictory results probably reflect the different methodologies. Lee <italic>et al.</italic> depleted PRKRA by RNAi from a HeLa cell line that expresses pri-miR-30a from the tetracycline-inducible promoter. After incubation with siRNA, the cell line was exposed to doxycycline, the derivative of tetracycline, for induction of pri-miR-30a. By using northern blotting on miR-30a, they found that reduction of PRKRA protein levels results in reduced miRNA accumulation. While we co-transfected siRNA and miRNA-expressing vector into HeLa cell line. By using miRNA quantitative-RT&#x02013;PCR, we found that PRKRA siRNAs could facilitate the accumulation of miRNA. Moreover, we co-transfected PRKRA siRNAs and miR-30a-expressing vector (the specific miRNA investigated by Lee <italic>et al.</italic>) into HeLa cell line. Forty-eight hours after transfection, we employed miRNA quantitative-RT&#x02013;PCR to detect miR-30a expression and found that PRKRA siRNAs could also facilitate the accumulation of miR-30a (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr715/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>).</p><p>An interesting paradox exists between TRBP and PRKRA, which shares 42% amino acid sequence identity. TRBP inhibits the dsRNA-activated PKR, whereas PRKRA activates this protein&#x02014;both using their C-terminal domains for these functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkr715-B31">31</xref>). TRBP and PRKRA could interact with Dicer, raising the intriguing possibility that TRBP and PRKRA modulate PKR differentially in response to dsRNAs in the cytoplasm. For instance, it would be disadvantageous to the cell to have miRNA precursors activating PKR, as this may ultimately lead to cell death. Thus, our findings suggest that TRBP and PRKRA might be responsible for keeping the balance between PKR pathway and pre-miRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkr715-F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, miR-122, a hepato-specific miRNA, inhibits the expression of Dicer-interacting PRKRA gene by binding to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of PRKRA mRNA and thereby facilitates the accumulation of newly synthesized miRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkr715/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online: Supplementary material, Supplementary tables, Supplementary figures 1&#x02013;5.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Chinese State Key Projects for Basic Research</funding-source> (<award-id>2010CB912801</award-id>, <award-id>2007CB914601</award-id>); partially by grants from <funding-source>Chinese Key Project for the Infectious Diseases</funding-source> (<award-id>2008ZX10002-016</award-id>); and <funding-source>Chinese National Natural Science Foundation</funding-source> (<award-id>30870529</award-id>, <award-id>30873008</award-id>).
