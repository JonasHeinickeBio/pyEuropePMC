Recruitment for Time-point 1 (n = 331) took place from May to July 2023 and Time-point 2 (n = 266; 80% retention rate) took place between Sept and Nov 2023 using Prolific (an online recruitment platform). The mean age was 51.65 (SD = 13.99). The mean length of remission in months was 89.45 (SD = 80.59) and mean years since diagnosis was 8.91 (SD = 6.99). Data were analysed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Covariates adjusted for included age, years since diagnosis, time in remission, ethnicity, cancer type and cancer stage.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Cross-sectional hierarchical regression analyses showed Time-point 1 psychological flexibility significantly (at p &lt; .001) predicted anxiety, depression, stress, fatigue interference, fear of cancer recurrence, quality of life and pain interference. Psychological flexibility at Time-point 1 significantly predicted all psychosocial variables at Time-point 2, while adjusting for confounding variables.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The findings show that psychological flexibility predicts key psychosocial outcomes relevant for people in remission from cancer. This study provides evidence for the relevance of psychological processes targeted in ACT-based interventions in the context of people living with and beyond cancer.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1359-107X</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:2044-8287</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=9605409</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40464630"><dc:title>Mental Comorbidity and Psychosocial Care in Patients With Cancer.</dc:title><dc:creator>Dinkel, A</dc:creator><dc:creator>Goerling, U</dc:creator><dc:creator>Karger, A</dc:creator><dc:creator>Teufel, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zimmermann, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Stengel, A</dc:creator><dc:description>Review; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-08-22</dc:date><dcterms:available>2025-08-22</dcterms:available><dcterms:created>2025-08-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40464630</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2025.0086</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Dinkel A, Goerling U, Karger A, Teufel M, Zimmermann T, Stengel A.

The point prevalence of any mental disorder in patients with cancer is 20% to 50%. Common disease-associated psychological symptoms include distress (a non-specific experience of emotional discomfort), demoralization, and fear of cancer recurrence or progression. These can cause severe suffering even if they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for any particular mental disorder. Mental comorbidity is associated with complications of treatment, lesser adherence to treatment, lower quality of life, and increased mortality. Psychotherapeutic interventions are effective and show moderate to large effects in current meta-analyses with respect to the reduction of anxiety and depression and improvement in quality of life. These effects persist over several months of follow-up. The empirical evidence for psychopharmacotherapy in cancer patients is limited. Psychopharmacological treatment should be integrated into an overall psycho-oncological treatment plan.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;A large body of evidence shows that mental comorbidity is common among cancer patients and harmful to them. Psychotherapeutic interventions lessen the symptoms of mental disturbances and improve quality of life. Nonetheless, despite improvements in recent years, there are remaining barriers to the adequate provision of psychosocial care.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1866-0452</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1866-0452</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=101475967</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40493882"><dc:title>The Probability of Remaining Under Active Surveillance for Localized Prostate Cancer: An Analysis of Young Patients in the Framework of the Multicenter ProjuMa Registry Study.</dc:title><dc:creator>Claassen, K</dc:creator><dc:creator>Justenhoven, C</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hermann, S</dc:creator><dc:creator>Brandhorst, J</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lakes, J</dc:creator><dc:creator>Werner, D</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kajüter, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Karpinski, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Arndt, V</dc:creator><dc:creator>Stang, A</dc:creator><dc:creator>Albers, P</dc:creator><dc:description>Journal Article; Observational Study</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-25</dc:date><dcterms:available>2025-07-25</dcterms:available><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40493882</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2025.0081</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Claassen K, Justenhoven C, Hermann S, Brandhorst J, Lakes J, Werner D, Kajüter H, Karpinski M, Arndt V, Stang A, Albers P.

Limited evidence is available on the continuation of active surveillance in young prostate cancer patients in Germany.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Using data that were reported, as required by law, to the population-based cancer registries of the German federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Württemberg, and Rhineland-Palatinate, we studied the course of 732 patients under 60 years of age who were in active surveillance after receiving a diagnosis of low-risk localized prostate cancer (ISUP grade 1 or 2) in the years 2016-2021.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The median duration of follow-up was 28 months. 64% [61%; 68%] of the patients were still under active surveillance at two years; this was true for 66% [62%; 70%] of those with ISUP grade 1 disease, 46% [37%; 58%] of those with ISUP grade 2 disease, and 72% [63%; 83%] of those for whom no Gleason grading was available. 62% of discontinuations occurred without any documented progression and without a documented patient-initiated decision.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The two-year probability of young prostate cancer patients remaining under active surveillance was lower in Germany than in other countries. The cancer registries mostly received no information concerning the clinical rationale for the discontinuations. The potentially incomplete reporting of reasons for discontinuing active surveillance suggests that clinical reporting practices should be improved.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1866-0452</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1866-0452</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=101475967</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40437959"><dc:title>Co-Designed Culturally Tailored Cancer Screening Promotion Program With Chinese-Australian: Using a Community Partnership Approach.</dc:title><dc:creator>Kwok, C</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xu, X</dc:creator><dc:contributor>School of Nursing, Paramedicine and Healthcare Sciences, Faculty of Science and Health, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, Australia.</dc:contributor><dc:subject>Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Promotion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Early Detection of Cancer</dc:subject><dc:description>research-article; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-01</dc:date><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40437959</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.70059</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:accessRights>Open Access</dcterms:accessRights><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Kwok C, Xu X.

Cultural beliefs, language barriers and limited health literacy contribute to this disparity, highlighting the need for culturally tailored interventions.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A culturally tailored cancer awareness education and screening promotion program was developed and implemented using a community partnership approach. A consumer engagement panel comprising Chinese community members, cancer survivors and community leaders was established to guide program development and implementation. Twenty-four educational sessions were delivered in Cantonese or Mandarin to 821 Chinese-Australians. The program's effectiveness was evaluated using pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessing cancer knowledge, screening awareness and screening intentions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Significant improvements were observed in participants' awareness of screening practices (bowel screening: 50.1% to 100%; breast awareness: 78.8% to 100%; mammogram: 65.8% to 95.6%; cervical screening: 86.5% to 96.9%). Screening intentions within 6 months increased substantially across all cancer types (bowel: 7.4% to 37%; breast awareness: 21.2% to 77.6%; mammogram: 18.9% to 47.7%; cervical: 39.8% to 73.1%). About 9 out of 13 questions regarding cancer knowledge and beliefs showed significant improvement post-intervention.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The community partnership approach and culturally tailored cancer education effectively improved cancer screening awareness and intentions among Chinese-Australians. SO WHAT?: This study provides a successful model for developing and implementing culturally sensitive cancer screening promotion programmes, which can be adapted for other CALD communities to address health disparities in cancer screening participation.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isVersionOf>http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12120539</dcterms:isVersionOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1036-1073</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=9710936</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40377773"><dc:title>Correction: Spatial organization of B lymphocytes and prognosis prediction in patients with gastric cancer.</dc:title><dc:creator>Tay, RYK</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sachdeva, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ma, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kim, YW</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kook, MC</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kim, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cheong, JH</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hewitt, LC</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nekolla, K</dc:creator><dc:creator>Schmidt, G</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yoshikawa, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Oshima, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Arai, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Srivastava, S</dc:creator><dc:creator>Teh, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ong, X</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tay, ST</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sheng, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhao, JJ</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tan, P</dc:creator><dc:creator>Grabsch, HI</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sundar, R</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.</dc:contributor><dc:description>Published Erratum; correction</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-01</dc:date><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40377773</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-025-01625-7</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:accessRights>Open Access</dcterms:accessRights><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Tay RYK, Sachdeva M, Ma H, Kim YW, Kook MC, Kim H, Cheong JH, Hewitt LC, Nekolla K, Schmidt G, Yoshikawa T, Oshima T, Arai T, Srivastava S, Teh M, Ong X, Tay ST, Sheng T, Zhao JJ, Tan P, Grabsch HI, Sundar R.

Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is of particular interest in cancer treatment research. It is known that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S has apoptotic and antiproliferative effects.&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;We aimed to examine the potential effects of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donor NaHS and paclitaxel, both individually and when co-administered, on the ID8 murine epithelial ovarian cancer cell line.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We examined the effects of the co-administration of paclitaxel and NaHS on cell viability, cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), apoptosis, and proliferation in the ID8 ovarian cancer cell line. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase tests were performed to ascertain the effect of NaHS and paclitaxel on cell viability and cytotoxicity. Caspase 3/7 levels were quantified in order to detect whether apoptosis is caspase dependent. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method was used to ascertain relative mRNA levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, and Bak genes.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The viability of ID-8 cells showed a significant reduction following the co-administration of paclitaxel and NaHS, compared to the paclitaxel administration only. The results of qPCR analysis demonstrated significant alterations in the Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bak, Casp3, Casp8, and Casp9 genes' mRNA levels following cotreatment. In contrast to paclitaxel alone, its co-administration with NaHS resulted in increased apoptosis and decreased ROS levels. The presence of NaHS has been observed to enhance the apoptotic impact of paclitaxel by amplifying the decline in MMP.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These data indicate that co-administration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S with paclitaxel could be useful as a potential agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer. We found that the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S enhanced the antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:0767-3981</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1472-8206</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=8710411</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40530674"><dc:title>An examination of factors associated with disparities in clinical trial eligibility guided by the Socioecological Model.</dc:title><dc:creator>Zhao, Y</dc:creator><dc:creator>Amorrortu, RP</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hicks, JK</dc:creator><dc:creator>Garcia, MA</dc:creator><dc:creator>Haura, EB</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yin, J</dc:creator><dc:creator>Vadaparampil, ST</dc:creator><dc:creator>Rollison, DE</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Cancer Epidemiology Program, H.

In the current study, the authors investigated associations between demographic characteristics and factors associated with CCT eligibility and enrollment using real-world data.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 113,030 adult patients with cancer who were treated at Moffitt Cancer Center between 2011 and 2021. Eligibility criteria from 100 CCTs were manually abstracted and conceptually mapped to variables in the Moffitt Cancer Analytics Platform. Other factors potentially affecting patient eligibility or enrollment in CCTs were identified following the Socioecological Model and were compared across patient groups by age, sex, race, and ethnicity.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The most frequent eligibility criteria in the abstracted CCTs included laboratory results associated with liver function (89%) and bone marrow function (88%). Thirty-nine percent of the protocols required genetic testing. Black/African American patients experienced a higher prevalence of diabetes (Δ = 3.2%), human immunodeficiency virus infection (Δ = 1.4%), and abnormal laboratory results compared with White patients. Hispanic patients experienced a higher prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection (Δ = 0.2%) and a history of organ transplantation (Δ = 0.2%) compared with non-Hispanic patients. Compared with younger patients, older adults had a higher prevalence of nononcologic conditions. Female, Black, and/or Hispanic patients were more likely to experience barriers to care, including childcare and transportation, and to live in more socially deprived areas compared with male, White, or non-Hispanic patients.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Restrictive CCT eligibility criteria and social determinants of health may pose structural barriers that disproportionately affect patient diversity. Investigators should leverage real-world data to design appropriate trial eligibility criteria.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:0008-543X</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1097-0142</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=0374236</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40536418"><dc:title>The Early Detection, Diagnostic Evaluation, and Local Treatment of Prostate Cancer: A Paradigm Shift.</dc:title><dc:creator>Albers, P</dc:creator><dc:creator>Franiel, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kötter, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kristiansen, G</dc:creator><dc:creator>Herrmann, K</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wiegel, T</dc:creator><dc:description>Review; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-25</dc:date><dcterms:available>2025-07-25</dcterms:available><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40536418</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2025.0099</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Albers P, Franiel T, Kötter T, Kristiansen G, Herrmann K, Wiegel T.

New data on the early detection, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of prostate cancer provide the basis for a paradigm shift in the management of locally confined prostate cancer.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;This narrative review is based on the systematic literature search that was carried out for the 2025 update of the German clinical practice guideline on prostate cancer.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Risk-adapted early detection is now recommended. This involves the measurement of a baseline PSA value at age 45 whose magnitude determines the interval of follow-up testing: once every 5 years for baseline values below 1.5 ng/mL, and once every two years for baseline values between 1.5 and 3 ng/mL. Patients with PSA levels above 3 ng/mL should undergo a repeat PSA test and, if these levels are confirmed, receive a urological risk assessment including prostatic volume, family history, and past medical history. High risk patients should undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, if necessary, prostate biopsy. This new PSA-MRI algorithm increases accuracy in detecting clinically significant prostate cancers, enabling the previously recommended annual testing and digital rectal examination to be avoided. Another novelty is that the indication for an active surveillance strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer has been expanded to ISUP grade group 1 and 2 cancers with favorable risk.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The need for high-quality diagnostic testing, including MRI, with broad geographic coverage will be a major challenge to the health care system, especially with regard to accessibility. Patients can be expected to benefit greatly from the new PSA-MRI algorithm, as it eliminates unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatment while enabling necessary treatment to be initiated earlier and therefore with fewer side effects.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1866-0452</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1866-0452</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=101475967</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40516981"><dc:title>Radiopharmaceuticals in Prostate Cancer: General Considerations and Utility in Combination With EBRT.</dc:title><dc:creator>Civan, C</dc:creator><dc:creator>Guberina, N</dc:creator><dc:creator>Krafft, U</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fendler, WP</dc:creator><dc:creator>Stuschke, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Herrmann, K</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Essen, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), West German Cancer Center, Essen, Germany..

Over the years, various radiopharmaceuticals have been utilized for both the diagnosis and treatment of the prostate cancer. Recent advancements in prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) based imaging have enabled the early and precise detection of local recurrence, lymph nodes or distant metastases, resulting a paradigm shift, which significantly influenced clinical decision making. Moreover, PSMA targeted treatments, as a part of theranostic approach, have introduced novel treatment options for patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer, who were previously limited to palliative treatment alternatives. The clinical integration of PSMA based imaging and treatment has led to the commencement of collaborative studies across multiple disciplines including radiation oncology. Radiopharmaceuticals led by PSMA have the potential to facilitate accurate treatment decision making through earlier and more precise lesion detection, as well as improve patient outcomes when combined with radiotherapy. We aimed to review the role of radiopharmaceuticals in diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, focusing on their utility in guiding radiotherapy and the potential benefits of combining these radiopharmaceuticals with radiotherapy.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1053-4296</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1532-9461</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=9202882</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40356016"><dc:title>The Co-Design of an Evidence-Based Health Education Strategy to Improve Bowel Cancer Awareness and Screening in a Remote Tasmanian Community: Lessons Learned.</dc:title><dc:creator>Gadd, N</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lee, S</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sharman, MJ</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hughes, J</dc:creator><dc:creator>Hoang, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Obamiro, K</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Centre for Rural Health, School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, Launceston, Australia.</dc:contributor><dc:subject>Colorectal Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Education</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rural Population</dc:subject><dc:subject>Health Promotion</dc:subject><dc:subject>Early Detection of Cancer</dc:subject><dc:description>research-article; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-01</dc:date><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40356016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.70052</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:accessRights>Open Access</dcterms:accessRights><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Gadd N, Lee S, Sharman MJ, Hughes J, Hoang H, Obamiro K.

Rural/remote Tasmanians may need increased awareness to encourage screening, with recent decreased screening rates. This study aimed to co-design a health education strategy to improve bowel cancer awareness/screening in remote Tasmania.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A co-design method was used to conduct two group workshops with 17 participants (14 community members, three healthcare providers). Workshops were guided by previous interviews with the community. Workshop one: participants chose the top three screening barriers and designed interventions to overcome them. These interventions were collated and presented to participants in workshop two. Participants shared ideas to refine interventions, then completed an acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness questionnaire of the overall strategy. Data was collected via written notes and analysed through content analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A health education strategy with two components and multiple interventions was developed: local media campaign (signage, video, bookmark, flyer, poster) and community health education events. Events included community champions sharing personal stories and healthcare providers providing clinical information. Participants identified the strategy as feasible, appropriate and acceptable for a rural/remote Tasmanian community. Following workshops, strategy components were developed in collaboration with the community.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Large scale strategies which may be effective for metropolitan areas of Australia may not be accepted by or appropriate for those in rural/remote areas. Remote community members valued local relevance and community involvement. SO WHAT?: If successful, the health education strategy could be implemented across rural/remote Tasmania to raise awareness/encourage screening.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isVersionOf>http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12069736</dcterms:isVersionOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1036-1073</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=9710936</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40536727"><dc:title>Untangling the mystery of rising breast cancer rates: In this first of a two-part series on new investigations into rising breast and colorectal cancer rates, researchers are grappling with spiking rates of specific breast cancers, particularly among younger women.</dc:title><dc:creator>Nelson, B</dc:creator><dc:creator>Faquin, W</dc:creator><dc:description>News</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-01</dc:date><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40536727</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1002/cncy.70026</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Nelson B, Faquin W.

This study aims to describe the burden of breast cancer in older adults worldwide, analyze the temporal trends for older breast cancer incidence, and assess the socioeconomic inequalities of breast cancer incidence and mortality with human development index (HDI) levels, which will provide valuable information in preventing and controlling the increasing breast cancer burden in older people.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The incidence and mortality rates of specific cancer types in older individuals in 2022 were sourced from the Global Cancer Today database. Trends in breast cancer incidence acquired from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) database. HDI and other risk factors were obtained from the United Nations. We used a generalized linear model to estimate the rate ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) between HDI levels and breast cancer burden in older people.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;It was estimated approximately 1,058,466 newly diagnosed breast cancer cases and 383,774 breast cancer deaths in women ≥60 years, accounting for 18.9% and 12.7% of world cancer cases and deaths. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) were 172.9 and 57.7 per 100,000, ranking first and second among all cancer incidence and mortality in older women. The highest ASIR and ASMR were four-fold higher than the lowest, with ASIR ranging from a peak of 399.1 per 100,000 in Australia-New Zealand to a low of 90.6 per 100,000 in South Central Asia, and ASMR varying from a high of 118.6 per 100,000 in Melanesia to a low of 28.8 per 100,000 in East Asia. The largest increases in ASIR from 1998-2002 to 2013-2017 were observed in South Korea, China, and Estonia. The corresponding estimated 5-year average percentage changes (EAPC) were 6.01%, 2.89%, and 1.93%, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The global burden of breast cancer in older women is increasing fast and varies greatly across countries.

This study analyzed the anatomical characteristics of the prostatic artery using computed tomographic (CT) angiography and developed a three-dimensional (3D)-printed prostate cancer model for PAE training. Computed tomographic images from 37 control dogs and 14 prostate cancer dogs were analyzed, with 102 pelvic sides classified into three types: the prostatic arteries originated from the internal pudendal artery in 100, an internal iliac artery in 1, and the umbilical artery in 1. Bodyweight was positively correlated with the diameters of the abdominal aorta and pelvic arteries in both groups. (p &lt;.01). However, the normalized prostatic artery diameter was significantly larger for the prostate cancer group (p &lt;.05). Computed tomography revealed local invasion of the bladder in 11 of the 14 dogs. Of 9 of the 11 dogs with confirmed bladder invasion, the caudal vesical, umbilical, and prostatic arteries were cancer-feeding in 9, 1, and 9, respectively. Based on the CT angiography images, a 3D-printed prostate cancer model was developed using a representative case that was close to the average value of each arterial blood vessel diameter. The model was used to simulate PAE, and successful embolization was confirmed using fluoroscopic guidance.

Pre-clinical evidence suggests that time-restricted eating (TRE), a type of intermittent fasting, induces metabolic effects and alterations in the gut microbiome that may impede carcinogenesis. Research on TRE in cancer has progressed to human studies, but the evidence has yet to be synthesized.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;The objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the clinical and/or metabolomic effects of TRE compared with ad libitum eating or alternative diets in people with cancer.&lt;h4&gt;Data sources&lt;/h4&gt;Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (ESCI, CPCI-SSH, CPCI-S), and SCOPUS were searched up to January 4, 2023, using the core concepts of "intermittent fasting" and "cancer." Original study designs, protocols, and clinical trial registries were included.&lt;h4&gt;Data extraction&lt;/h4&gt;After evaluating 13 900 results, 24 entries were included, consisting of 8 full articles, 2 abstracts, 1 published protocol and 13 trial registries. All data were extracted, compared, and critically analyzed.&lt;h4&gt;Data analysis&lt;/h4&gt;There was heterogeneity in the patient population (eg, in tumor sites), TRE regimens (eg, degree of restriction, duration), and clinical end points. A high rate (67-98%) of TRE adherence was observed, alongside improvements in quality of life. Four articles assessed cancer markers and found a reduction in tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen, reduced rates of recurrence, and a sustained major molecular response, following TRE. Five articles demonstrated modified cancer risk factors, including beneficial effects on body mass index, adiposity, glucoregulation, and inflammation in as short a period as 8 weeks. None of the completed studies assessed the effect of TRE on the microbiome, but analysis of the microbiome is a planned outcome in 2 clinical trials.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Preliminary findings suggest that TRE is feasible and acceptable by people with cancer, may have oncological benefits, and improves quality of life.&lt;h4&gt;Registration&lt;/h4&gt;PROSPERO registration No. CRD42023386885.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isVersionOf>http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12166167</dcterms:isVersionOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:0029-6643</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1753-4887</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=0376405</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40506198"><dc:title>Advancing paediatric cancer care in Jordan: a strategic 10-year roadmap.</dc:title><dc:creator>Rihani, R</dc:creator><dc:creator>Awidi, A</dc:creator><dc:creator>Barbar, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mustafa, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tutunji, L</dc:creator><dc:creator>Rayyan, Y</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mansour, A</dc:creator><dc:creator>Abdel-Razeq, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sultan, I</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Department of Pediatrics, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan; School of Medicine, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.

We outline a comprehensive 10-year roadmap for advancing paediatric cancer care in Jordan, which was developed by national experts in paediatric oncology and public health. The roadmap emphasises a holistic, patient-centred approach that prioritises equitable, accessible, and high-quality care for children. Spanning the entire cancer care continuum, from early detection and diagnosis to treatment, survivorship, and palliative care, the roadmap emphasises psychosocial support for families. Key priorities include capacity building, standardised treatment regimens, and evidence-based practices, as well as community engagement to promote cancer awareness and reduce stigma. In this roadmap, we also highlight the need for innovative therapies, expanded research capacity, and workforce development to address the unique needs of children with cancer. A proposed consensus-driven monitoring system will ensure sustainable implementation and progress in paediatric oncology services in Jordan.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with risk factors including lifestyle, genetic predisposition, and hormonal influences. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a robust epidemiological tool, uses genetic variants to assess causal relationships between exposures and breast cancer risk. Evidence suggests that obesity, particularly in adulthood, is associated with elevated risk, while early obesity may be protective. Alcohol consumption shows a complex relationship, with adverse effects associated with problematic drinking behaviors rather than moderate drinking. Physical activity is associated with reduced breast cancer risk, likely through hormonal and metabolic pathways. Dietary factors, such as higher intake of monounsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E, appear protective, highlighting the importance of dietary choices. Methodological considerations, including pleiotropy and sample size, are crucial to ensure the validity of MR studies. Overall, this synthesis of existing studies demonstrates the importance of Mendelian randomization (MR) in identifying causal links between modifiable risk factors and breast cancer, which is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isVersionOf>http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12170467</dcterms:isVersionOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:2730-6011</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:2730-6011</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=101775142</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40245290"><dc:title>Factors Driving Pancreatic Cancer Survival Rates.</dc:title><dc:creator>Rahib, L</dc:creator><dc:creator>Coffin, T</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kenner, B</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Kenner Family Research Fund, New York, NY.</dc:contributor><dc:subject>Pancreatic Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:description>research-article; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-01</dc:date><dcterms:available>2025-07-01</dcterms:available><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40245290</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1097/mpa.0000000000002489</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:accessRights>Open Access</dcterms:accessRights><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Rahib L, Coffin T, Kenner B.

Stage distribution and survival rates were combined to evaluate the contribution of each stage to the overall survival rate.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The most recent SEER 17 data registry reports an overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer of 12%, with rates varying significantly across stages and age groups. The overall 5-year survival, irrespective of stage at the time of diagnosis, increased from 6% for patients diagnosed in 2004 to 12% for those diagnosed in 2015. During this same period, the incidence rate of distant disease decreased from 60% to 53%; however, the 5-year survival rate only increased from 2% to 3%, suggesting minimal advancements in treatment outcomes for individuals identified with distant disease at the time of diagnosis. In contrast, the 5-year survival rate for localized disease rose from 24% to 46%, while the stage distribution only slightly increased from 11% to 14% during the same period. Survival rates for distant disease at 4-, 3-, 2-year did not increase, however, the 1-year survival increased from 14% to 22% (2004-2019). These trends suggest progress in short-term outcomes, aligning with the availability of new FDA-approved treatments for advanced or metastatic disease with a median overall survival of &lt;1 year.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This research confirms that the overall 5-year survival rate of 12% primarily reflects improved survival among those diagnosed with localized disease. Importantly, since only 14% of patients are diagnosed at this stage, the survival rate for most patients remains unchanged. This work also emphasizes the need for more research around variables that influence the overall 5-year survival rate, along with greater investment in early detection strategies to improve patient survival.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isVersionOf>http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12175802</dcterms:isVersionOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:0885-3177</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1536-4828</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=8608542</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40518973"><dc:title>Challenges to women's cancer control in Morocco: a qualitative study of lay advisors and civil society perspectives.</dc:title><dc:creator>Luo, A</dc:creator><dc:creator>Naamaoui, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Soliman, A</dc:creator><dc:creator>Obtel, M</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kaikani, W</dc:creator><dc:creator>Charaka, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nejjari, C</dc:creator><dc:creator>Khalis, M</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.</dc:contributor><dc:subject>Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Community Health Workers</dc:subject><dc:description>research-article; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-06-16</dc:date><dcterms:available>2025-06-16</dcterms:available><dcterms:created>2025-06-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40518973</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1017/s1463423625100169</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:accessRights>Open Access</dcterms:accessRights><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Luo A, Naamaoui M, Soliman A, Obtel M, Kaikani W, Charaka H, Nejjari C, Khalis M.

Activities focused on strengthening multisectoral collaboration in cancer care and control, including promoting early detection in primary care. Despite progress in reducing women's cancer mortality, socio-cultural challenges impede further gains. Elucidating the perspectives of the community-based and civil society allied in cancer control is critical to addressing cancer disparities.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Data were collected through in-depth interviews with cancer lay health advisors (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10) and civil society members (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10) on topics of challenges and opportunities to improve care-seeking and treatment. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and guided by the socio-ecological model.&lt;h4&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;Barriers and facilitators to early diagnosis and treatment were identified at levels of the individual, family, community/societal, and the health system. Barriers to early detection include taboo and stigma, fear of death, and gender norms and roles. Financial and geographic barriers, lack of psychosocial support, and poor health system/provider communication were major deterrents related to treatment. Results suggest intervention targets to reduce late-stage presentation for women, including enhancing educational efforts and augmenting community outreach linkages to primary care.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isVersionOf>http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC12175096</dcterms:isVersionOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1463-4236</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1477-1128</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=100897390</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40536077"><dc:title>Second-hand smoke and bladder cancer risk among nonsmokers: a systematic review and a meta-analysis.</dc:title><dc:creator>Carreras, G</dc:creator><dc:creator>Possenti, I</dc:creator><dc:creator>Malevolti, MC</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gorini, G</dc:creator><dc:creator>Gallus, S</dc:creator><dc:creator>Lugo, A</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Institute for Cancer Research, Prevention and Clinical Network (ISPRO), Florence.</dc:contributor><dc:description>Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-06-18</dc:date><dcterms:available>2025-06-18</dcterms:available><dcterms:created>2025-06-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40536077</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1097/cej.0000000000000979</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Carreras G, Possenti I, Malevolti MC, Gorini G, Gallus S, Lugo A.

While tobacco smoking is a well-established risk factor for bladder cancer, the association between second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure and bladder cancer remains less clear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to update the evidence on the association between SHS exposure and bladder cancer risk, considering sex differences and exposure settings. By combining an umbrella review and a systematic review, we identified and combined in a meta-analysis all epidemiological studies assessing the association between SHS exposure and bladder cancer risk in nonsmokers, published up until October 2023. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. Twelve studies (eight case-control and four cohort studies), involving approximately 1200 bladder cancer cases, were included. The overall pooled RR of bladder cancer for SHS exposure was 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.43], with slight differences when considering exposure settings. Results show a low/moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 38%, P = 0.09). Stratified analyses by sex showed no differences in risk of bladder cancer by sex, with an RR of 1.35 (95% CI: 0.86-2.13) in males and 1.31 (95% CI: 0.98-1.73) in females. Higher risks were observed in studies conducted in Africa and Asia. This meta-analysis considering sex differences and different exposure settings shows an increased, despite not statistically significant, association between SHS exposure and bladder cancer risk among nonsmokers. A relatively limited number of cases and studies are currently available on the issue, thus further research with greater statistical power and improved exposure assessment is needed to better clarify the role of SHS exposure in bladder cancer development.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:0959-8278</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1473-5709</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=9300837</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/39038316"><dc:title>Analysis of Factors Associated with Cough Persistence After Thoracoscopic Lung Cancer Resection in Elderly Lung Cancer Patients and Discussion of Prevention Strategies.</dc:title><dc:creator>Yu, L</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhang, Z</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wang, Z</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sun, F</dc:creator><dc:subject>Lung Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cough</dc:subject><dc:subject>Postoperative Complications</dc:subject><dc:subject>Thoracoscopy</dc:subject><dc:description>Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-01</dc:date><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/39038316</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Yu L, Zhang Z, Wang Z, Sun F.

However, multifactorial analysis showed that preoperative history of smoking, the side of the operation being the right side, the extent of the operation being the lobes of the lungs, the time of tracheal intubation ≥172 min, the peritracheal lymph node clearance, and the occurrence of postoperative acid reflux were independent risk factors for the occurrence of persistent cough in patients after thoracoscopic lung cancer resection, while preoperative respiratory training was a protective factor (P &lt; .05).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;There are many factors affecting persistent cough after thoracoscopic lung cancer resection.

This study aims to assess the 5-year relative survival of patients with cancer in Fujian Province, southeastern China, between 2021 and 2023.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The new cases of cancer in 25 cancer registries in Fujian Province from 2016 to 2021 were included in this study, and patients' survival status was followed up until March 1, 2024. The hybrid method was used to calculate cancer relative survival by gender, region and age (2021-2023), and results were standardized according to International Cancer Survival Standards Weights.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;There were 184,216 patients were included in the study after quality control, including 101,338 males and 82,878 females. The 5-year relative survival for all cancers combined was 51.7 %, and the age-standardized 5-year relative survival was 43.8 % in 2021-2023. The age-standardized 5-year relative survival was higher in females than males (52.7 % and 36.3 %). The survival in urban was higher than that in rural areas (49.3 % and 37.9 %). The three types of cancer with the highest survival in males were thyroid (94.5 %), testicular (77.7 %), bladder (69.1 %). In females, thyroid cancer (94.9 %), breast cancer (77.6 %) and bladder cancer (72.1 %) were the three cancers with the highest survival. Most cancer survival was higher in females than in males. The relative survival decreased with age, the highest survival was 79.5 % in the age group under 45 years old and the lowest survival was 21.8 % in the age 75 and above.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The cancer survival rates in Fujian Province have reached the goal of Healthy China 2030, but there is still a gap with high survival areas. To narrow this gap, more targeted interventions are needed to further improve cancer survival.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1877-7821</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1877-783X</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=101508793</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40530769"><dc:title>Understanding Unwarranted Variation in Care for Victorian Oesophagogastric Cancer Patients Using Linked Data: A Comparative Analysis Between 2012-2016 and 2017-2021.</dc:title><dc:creator>Graham, F</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chu, W</dc:creator><dc:creator>Rodi, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cashin, P</dc:creator><dc:creator>Liu, DS</dc:creator><dc:creator>Finn, N</dc:creator><dc:creator>Wong, THT</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nolte, L</dc:creator><dc:contributor>VICS Optimal Care Summits Program, Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia.</dc:contributor><dc:description>Review; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-06-18</dc:date><dcterms:available>2025-06-18</dcterms:available><dcterms:created>2025-06-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40530769</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.70196</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Graham F, Chu W, Rodi H, Cashin P, Liu DS, Finn N, Wong THT, Nolte L.

Statewide administrative datasets were assessed retrospectively at the population level in alignment with the optimal care pathway steps for OG.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Victorians with a primary diagnosis of OG cancer were identified via the Victorian Cancer Registry dataset and linked to various administrative datasets to identify unwarranted variations.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Of the 9868 Victorians diagnosed with OG cancer between 2012 and 2021, 39.4% were metastatic at diagnosis. Improved outcomes between time periods included reduced mortality for OG cancer and post-surgical mortality 1 year post gastrectomy. Patient multidisciplinary meeting presentation increased from 74% to 86%. Unwarranted variations included time from diagnosis to any treatment within 6 weeks for non-metastatic gastric cancer (64%, 2012-2016 and 60%, 2017-2021) and for oesophageal cancer patients (58%, 2012-2016 and 60%, 2017-2021). One regional Integrated Cancer Service (ICS) demonstrated statistically lower survival compared to the statewide average for gastric cancer in 2017-2021. There was greater variation in survival for gastric cancer for 2017-2021 compared to 2012-2016. Rates of dietitian and/or physiotherapist involvement within 3 months of diagnosis for OG cancer surgical and/or chemotherapy patients were low across all ICS and both time periods.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The Victorian cancer system demonstrates improved survival outcomes for OG cancer patients between the two time periods. Time between diagnosis and treatment, lower survival rates in some ICS, and access to supportive care (e.g., dietetics and physiotherapy) remain areas of deficiency.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1445-1433</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:1445-2197</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=101086634</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about="http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40476859"><dc:title>Imaging Cancer-associated Cachexia: Utilizing Clinical Imaging Modalities for Early Diagnosis.</dc:title><dc:creator>Jiang, Y</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zhao, Y</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dai, J</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yang, Q</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tang, X</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fu, L</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mao, H</dc:creator><dc:creator>Peng, XG</dc:creator><dc:contributor>Nurturing Center of Jiangsu Province for State Laboratory of AI Imaging &amp; Interventional Radiology, Department of Radiology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, 87 Dingjiaqiao Road, Nanjing, 210009, China.</dc:contributor><dc:subject>Neoplasms</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cachexia</dc:subject><dc:description>Review; Journal Article</dc:description><dc:date>2025-07-01</dc:date><dcterms:created>2025-07-01</dcterms:created><dc:identifier>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/40476859</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>https://doi.org/10.1148/rycan.240291</dc:identifier><dc:type>Text</dc:type><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dcterms:bibliographicCitation>Jiang Y, Zhao Y, Dai J, Yang Q, Tang X, Fu L, Mao H, Peng XG.

Despite the profound impact of CAC on clinical management and treatment outcomes of patients with cancer, the current understanding of mechanisms associated with the condition, as well as the tools necessary for early diagnosis, are limited. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of CAC relies on weight change-based assessments, which have limited sensitivity and cannot identify patients at risk for CAC. In this context, noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers, such as the composition and properties of adipose and muscle tissues, may allow for diagnosis of CAC before substantial weight loss occurs. Such early detection can potentially enable more timely and effective interventions. Furthermore, imaging allows for quantitative assessment of CAC, enabling monitoring of prognosis and treatment response. This article reviews current applications and future developments of imaging techniques, particularly those employed in current clinical radiology, that can reveal diagnostic information and facilitate early detection of CAC and quantitative evaluation of associated metabolic alterations. &lt;b&gt;Keywords:&lt;/b&gt; Molecular Imaging, Cancer, MRI, PET/CT, Ultrasound, Muscular, Oncology © RSNA, 2025.</dcterms:abstract><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:2638-616X</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>urn:ISSN:2638-616X</dcterms:isPartOf><dcterms:isPartOf>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=101765309</dcterms:isPartOf></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF></responseWrapper>
