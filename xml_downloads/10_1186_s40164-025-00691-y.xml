Consequently, developing strategies to optimize the suppression of collagen&#x02019;s promotive effects on tumor growth while maintaining its inhibitory functions on tumor initiation has become a key focus of cancer research and therapy. A significant challenge remains in identifying a biomarker with both high sensitivity and specificity for cancer diagnosis. This review, therefore, highlights the substantial value and clinical relevance of collagen as a biomarker throughout cancer onset and progression. It explores the fundamental link between collagen and immunotherapeutic outcomes, further illustrating how targeting collagen&#x02014;along with its interactions with tumors and immune cells&#x02014;can offer more reliable predictive markers for personalized immunotherapy. This approach ultimately enables the development of more tailored and standardized treatment regimens for patients with cancer.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="fr" id="Abs2"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2">Created in BioRender.com</p><p id="Par3">

In 2024, an estimated 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer-related deaths are projected in the U.S. alone, placing cancer second only to heart disease in terms of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers are among those with the highest fatality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. By 2040, the global cancer burden could reach 28.4&#x000a0;million cases, marking a 47% increase compared to 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over recent decades, two major breakthroughs in cancer therapy have emerged: the targeting of oncogene-driven tumors through molecular targeted therapy and advancements in tumor immunology, such as immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Immunotherapy, which leverages the host immune system to either passively or actively combat malignancies, has garnered significant attention. Notable approaches, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)&#x02014;which enhances immune responses against cancer cells by inhibiting specific proteins on tumor or immune cell surfaces&#x02014;cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell transfer, which genetically modifies a patient&#x02019;s immune cells to recognize specific tumor antigens, show immense promise as transformative cancer treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">With the rise of immunotherapy, a new paradigm in cancer treatment has emerged, shifting focus from solely cancer cells to the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), a critical determinant in tumor formation, progression, and metastasis. The extracellular matrix (ECM), a pivotal component of the TME, is predominantly secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a heterogeneous and plastic subset of activated fibroblasts. Collagen, a primary ECM component, plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of solid tumors, influencing tumor invasion, growth, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Its abundance and arrangement are intimately associated with tumor behavior. Numerous studies have demonstrated the upregulation of various collagen types across diverse malignancies, correlating closely with the efficacy of immunotherapeutic treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This review focuses on collagen, examining its essential properties and its role within the tumor immune microenvironment. Special attention is given to its potential as a biomarker for cancer initiation and progression and its synergistic effects with immunotherapy in clinical settings. These findings may provide novel insights into cancer monitoring, diagnosis, and therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Collagen fundamentals</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Collagen structure</title><p id="Par6">Collagen is one of the most prevalent proteins in the human body, representing approximately one-third of the total protein content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Predominantly found within the ECM, collagen members also contribute to cell membranes. In addition to their critical role in determining tissue architecture and morphology, they are involved in cellular adhesion, proliferation, and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Collagen consists of three polypeptide chains that form a stable triple helix. The amino acid composition of these chains, typically including glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, contributes to their remarkable thermal stability. The &#x003b1;-chains undergo enzymatic processing through N-terminal and C-terminal propeptide regions to form mature, triple-helical collagen. Although stable in neutral environments, this triple helix loses stability in charged conditions. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes crosslinking between collagen molecules, resulting in the formation of collagen fibrils or networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The collagen superfamily consists of 28 distinct members, classified into fibrillar and non-fibrillar types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These are further categorized based on structure, localization, and biological function, encompassing fibril-forming collagens, fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices, basement membrane collagens, beaded filament collagens, short- and long-chain collagens, collagens with multiple triple-helix domains, and membrane-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices. Collectively, these subtypes contribute to a complex matrix that provides structural integrity to tissues. Among them, Collagen type I (COL I), Collagen type III (COL III), and Collagen type V (COL V) are primarily synthesized by fibroblasts, while Collagen type IV (COL IV) is predominantly expressed by epithelial and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Research has predominantly focused on these subtypes. COL I, the most abundant, consists of two &#x003b1;1 chains and one &#x003b1;2 chain. In skin, it accounts for 80&#x02013;85% of the dermal ECM, and in bone tissue, it exceeds 90% <sup>8</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Collagen function</title><p id="Par8">Under normal physiological conditions, particularly during skin wound healing, collagen, together with elastin, ranks among the most abundant proteins in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Upon skin injury, platelets interact with exposed collagen from the ECM and endothelium, triggering coagulation and the clotting cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. During the repair process, changes in collagen subtypes, quantities, and organization directly influence the tensile strength of scar tissue. Collagen type XVII (COL XVII) plays a pivotal role in wound healing, acting as a stem cell marker and reflecting their self-renewal capacity, thus positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for anti-aging and wound treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Beyond its structural contribution to wound healing, collagen engages with other ECM components and cytokines to modulate inflammatory and reparative responses, stimulating the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by surrounding cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In certain tissue regeneration contexts, collagen serves as a guiding scaffold; for instance, in bone repair, extracellular mineralization of collagen mimics osteogenic processes, allowing osteoblasts to secrete and mineralize bone matrix on collagen scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Beyond its roles in wound healing, tissue regeneration, and structural support, collagen&#x02014;primarily structural types&#x02014;also impacts cell signaling, adhesion, proliferation, metastasis, and immune cell recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As the key structural component of all connective tissues, collagen is omnipresent in parenchymal organs, providing mechanical rigidity and structural stability. Its presence in basement membranes is closely associated with angiogenesis and cellular survival. Notably, COL IV within vascular endothelial cell (VEC) basement membranes plays a pivotal role in regulating angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. By interacting with ECM components such as laminin, COL IV creates a stable structural interface that not only offers mechanical support but also acts as a permeability barrier, maintaining homeostasis between the blood vessel interior and exterior. Additionally, RAS family proteins (RAB10 and RAB25) regulate COL IV through the transport of lysyl hydroxylase 3, ensuring vascular stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Consequently, a comprehensive investigation of collagen&#x02019;s role in vascular remodeling could inform the development of angiogenesis-targeted therapies in oncology.</p><p id="Par10">Collagen not only serves as the structural foundation of tissue architecture but also plays a pivotal role in remodeling processes that drive TME progression, particularly in tumor cell growth, infiltration, and metastasis. For example, collagen type X A1 facilitates epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting tumor cell dissemination. COL I shows potential as a diagnostic marker for metastatic tumors and is implicated in both primary bone cancers and cancer-associated bone metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. CAFs are the primary source of collagen synthesis within the TME, producing ECM components and regulating the expression of organ-specific and immunomodulatory chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition to CAFs, keratinocytes, VECs, smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and cancer cells also contribute to collagen synthesis.</p><p id="Par11">Numerous receptors on the cell surface recognize collagen, including integrins, discoidin domain receptors (DDRs), glycoprotein VI, the osteoclast-associated receptor, and G-protein-coupled receptor 56 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These collagen&#x02013;receptor interactions establish essential adhesion sites that facilitate signal transduction, proliferation, metastasis, and immune cell recruitment in tumor cells.</p><p id="Par12">In summary, collagen constitutes a diverse and functionally critical protein family, influencing various physiological processes, from tissue regeneration and wound repair to cell migration, angiogenesis, and the shaping of the TME. This complexity emphasizes its substantial research potential in tumor immunology and regenerative medicine. Following the exploration of collagen&#x02019;s core properties, its dynamic behavior within the TME and its impact on tumorigenesis and progression are further analyzed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Collagen synthesis and degradation</title><p id="Par14">Collagen biosynthesis is a multifaceted process involving both intracellular and extracellular stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It initiates in the cell nucleus, where mRNA transcripts for &#x003b1;-chains are synthesized, before migrating to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) for translation into prepro-&#x003b1;-chains. During this process, signal peptides are cleaved from the N-terminus, generating pro-&#x003b1;-chains, which undergo essential post-translational modifications, including hydroxylation and glycosylation, to ensure collagen stability and function. These modified pro-&#x003b1;-chains then assemble into a procollagen monomer, linked by disulfide bonds at the N- and C-terminal propeptide regions, forming a triple helix. This monomer is further modified with oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus before being packaged into secretory vesicles for extracellular export. Once outside the cell, collagen peptidases cleave the propeptide regions, converting procollagen to tropocollagen, which spontaneously assembles into fibrils. LOX facilitates the formation of covalent crosslinks between collagen molecules, stabilizing the fibril structure. CAFs play a significant role in modulating collagen&#x02019;s physical properties through LOX production. The dynamic balance of the ECM is maintained by collagenases and cathepsins that degrade collagen molecules.</p><p id="Par15">Collagen degradation also involves multiple enzymes and pathways, reflecting the protein&#x02019;s tightly coiled triple-helical structure, which offers substantial resistance to proteolysis. Only a few proteases are capable of cleaving native type I collagen under physiological conditions, primarily matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and certain cysteine proteases. The collagenases of the MMP family, including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, and MMP-14, are the main enzymes responsible for collagen digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In healthy tissues, ECM remodeling&#x02014;primarily driven by collagen degradation&#x02014;occurs in cycles of synthesis, secretion, and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved from the pre-&#x003b1; chain, which is then subjected to post-translational modifications in the RER lumen, including hydroxylation and glycosylation. Three modified pre-&#x003b1; chains assemble into a procollagen monomer, stabilized by disulfide bonds at both the N- and C-termini, forming a triple-helical structure.

</p><p id="Par21">Collagen serves as a key energy source for tumor cell growth. For example, COL I provides metabolically available substrates indirectly through byproducts generated by collagen-degrading stromal cells. The breakdown of collagen can also promote tumor growth, with proline, a degradation product, supporting tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Inhibiting collagen uptake by tumor cells or using insoluble collagen can induce tumor shrinkage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Additionally, collagen modulates the adhesion between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma through interactions with integrin family adhesion molecules. COL I and COL IV, in particular, significantly influence tumor progression by binding to these adhesion receptors. Studies show that other ECM components also play essential roles in collagen synthesis and deposition. For instance, the glycoprotein fibronectin, which functions in the extracellular space, affects both collagen deposition and adhesion. Moreover, research has demonstrated that fibronectin&#x02019;s interaction with focal adhesions can alter its conformation, exposing binding sites for other ECM molecules. As a result, fibronectin binds to collagen, laminin, and other proteins, facilitating cell adhesion to the ECM and promoting migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">Various cell-surface receptors recognize collagen, and upon binding, directly regulate cancer cell metabolism, proliferation, and malignancy.

This shift results from the suppression of the COL1A2 gene due to promoter DNA hypermethylation. Although the exact signaling pathway remains unclear, Ras may play a role in downregulating &#x003b1;2 chain expression. Compared to hetero-trimers, COL1 homo-trimers in cancer cells strongly induce phosphorylation of DDR1, FAK, AKT, and ERK.
