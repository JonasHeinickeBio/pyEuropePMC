These cells exert potent immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting T cell activation, inducing regulatory T cells, modulating antigen-presenting cells, and shaping an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Their suppressive functions involve multiple mechanisms, including amino acid depletion, production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, expression of immune checkpoint ligands, and secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;. Besides these immune-related roles, MDSCs also promote tumor growth through non-immunological mechanisms, including the stimulation of angiogenesis and undergoing metabolic reprogramming. These adaptations support their survival and function in the hostile TME. Given their multifaceted role in cancer, MDSCs represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, their abundance and dynamic modulation during treatment confer them tremendous potential as biomarkers to monitor therapy efficacy and stratify patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of MDSC biology, their mechanisms of action, and their emerging clinical relevance as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We also explore current strategies aimed at targeting MDSCs, including their depletion, inhibition of recruitment, functional blockade, and promotion of their differentiation into mature myeloid cells. Integrating these approaches with existing cancer therapies holds great promise for enhancing antitumor immunity and overcoming resistance in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>myeloid-derived suppressor cells</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>immune biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="184"/><page-count count="25"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The interplay between the immune system and cancer cells is complex and remains a subject of thorough investigation.

ARG1, commonly induced within MDSCs, catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine into urea and L-ornithine. This depletion of extracellular L-arginine availability impairs the proliferation of activated T cells<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> as it leads to downregulation of the CD3&#x003b6; chain of the TCR, arrest of the cell cycle in the G0&#x02013;G1 phase, and overall suppression of metabolic paths required for clonal expansion.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Likewise, MDSCs consume cystine and do not return cysteine to the extracellular environment, which is crucial for T-cell activation. T cells lack the enzyme cystathionine &#x003b3;-lyase, which converts methionine to cysteine, and do not express cystine transporters. Therefore, they cannot import cystine and reduce it intracellularly to cysteine. As a result, in the absence of cysteine-exporting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells (DC), cysteine deprivation severely restricts T-cell activation.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Furthermore, tryptophan degradation into immunosuppressive kynurenine metabolites through indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> activity in MDSCs contributes to autophagy induction, cell cycle arrest, and T cell apoptosis.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>MDSCs express inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules as well, notably programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interacts with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells, inducing exhaustion and anergy.
