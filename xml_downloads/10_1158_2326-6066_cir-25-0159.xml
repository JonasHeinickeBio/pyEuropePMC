Advances in single-cell omics and high-dimensional immune profiling have unveiled the remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity of these cells, revealing lineage-specialized functions that shape cancer immunity. These discoveries have sparked growing interest in therapeutically targeting myeloid cells as a next-generation strategy in cancer immunotherapy. As a complementary or alternative approach to T cell&#x02013;centered immunotherapies, myeloid-directed therapies offer unique opportunities to reprogram the immune landscape, enhance antitumor responses, and overcome resistance mechanisms. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries in myeloid cell biology in cancer and discuss emerging therapeutic targets, with an emphasis on antibody-based therapies that have reached clinical development. We further provide perspective on translational challenges to implement these approaches into the clinic and discuss how Fc-engineering and rational antibody design can optimize myeloid cell engagement and amplify their immune effector functions. Together, these advances position myeloid-directed immunotherapies as a promising approach to enhance the efficacy and durability of cancer treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>

Despite these successes, the majority of patients fail to achieve long-term benefit. To improve outcomes, ongoing clinical studies are evaluating combination strategies with currently approved ICB agents (i.e., anti&#x02013;CTLA-4, anti&#x02013;PD-1/PD-L1, and anti-LAG3), optimizing therapeutic timing (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant), or targeting additional T-cell checkpoints such as TIGIT, CD137, GITR, or OX40 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Despite these efforts, most of these approaches have not substantially expanded the effectiveness of immunotherapy, highlighting the need for novel strategies targeting other immune cells and pathways.</p><p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem comprising various cell populations, including stromal cells, B and T cells, NK cells, and diverse myeloid cell populations. Whereas T cells remain a central focus of cancer immunology because of their antigen-specific cytotoxic activity (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), they often represent a small fraction of the immune infiltrate. Many tumors, referred to as &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d; tumors, are poorly infiltrated by T cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), limiting the effectiveness of T cell&#x02013;based therapies. In contrast, myeloid cells are highly abundant across nearly all tumor types and represent a functionally diverse compartment capable of both promoting and restraining antitumor immunity. Intratumoral myeloid cells fall into two main categories: (i) mononuclear phagocytes, which include monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC), and (ii) granulocytes, primarily neutrophils, with smaller populations of eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells. Myeloid cells exhibit functional and phenotypic diversity within the TME (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), in which they can either support or suppress antitumor immunity depending on the environmental signals they sense. Myeloid cells also influence the success or failure of various cancer therapies, including ICB (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). As a result, the therapeutic modulation of myeloid cells represents a promising strategy to stimulate antitumor immunity, potentially synergizing with other cancer treatments, particularly T cell&#x02013;based immunotherapies.</p><p>In this review, we outline the role of myeloid cells during cancer immunity, discuss emerging insights into their activation states, and highlight key myeloid targets being investigated for cancer immunotherapy. We focus on clinically advanced antibody-based therapies and describe how antibody engineering can influence treatment efficacy for some of these therapies. For broader discussion on myeloid-targeted therapies, including synthetic ligands for myeloid cell receptors (e.g., TLR and STING agonists) and other small molecules, we refer our readers to recent reviews (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Macrophages: Double-Edged Architects of Cancer Immunity and Progression</title><p>Macrophages are among the most abundant immune cells in the TME and are often associated with poor prognosis and resistance to cancer therapies (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) contribute to cancer progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation, supporting angiogenesis, suppressing immune responses, and facilitating extracellular matrix degradation to aid cancer cell invasion (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, TAMs have also the potential to kill cancer cells and support tumor-specific T-cell responses, highlighting their dual role in cancer. Historically, macrophages have been categorized as M1 (antitumor) or M2 (protumor; ref. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, recent studies using single-cell transcriptomic methods have revealed a more complex picture. Rather than fitting into two stationary categories, macrophages exist on a spectrum of activation states that vary across tumor types, disease stages, and environmental cues (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Consequently, new markers derived from these studies have offered better indicators of macrophage functional diversity. For instance, in head and neck cancer, macrophages defined by <italic toggle="yes">CXCL9</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SPP1</italic> expression, rather than conventional M1/M2 markers, are more strongly associated with anti- and pro-tumoral properties, respectively, and hold significant prognostic value (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). This <italic toggle="yes">CXCL9</italic>:<italic toggle="yes">SPP1</italic> macrophage polarity model has now been validated in other tumor types (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), further supporting its role as a prognostic indicator in human cancers. TAMs integrate diverse environmental cues through multiple sensing pathways, which in turn shape their functional phenotype. However, the cell-intrinsic molecular circuits that regulate these phenotypes remain poorly understood. A recent single-cell CRISPR screen identified <italic toggle="yes">ZEB2</italic> as a master regulator of the immunosuppressive TAM program (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Such studies will help better define the regulatory network of TAMs and could lead to the identification of novel targets for their therapeutic reprogramming.</p><p>TAMs originate either from tissue-resident macrophages (TRM), which are present before tumorigenesis occurs, or monocyte-derived macrophages, which arise from circulating monocytes. Whereas TRMs and monocyte-derived macrophages can exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions in the TME (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), recent evidence suggest that TAM ontogeny may not faithfully distinguish anti- and protumoral TAMs. For instance, TRMs support tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis in lung cancer (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), whereas they are critical to control the dormancy of metastatic cancer cells in breast cancer (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), arguing that TAM origin could not be considered as a reliable parameter to explain their functional orientation.</p><p>Despite their ability to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC), TAMs generally fail to prime tumor-specific T cell responses (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Instead, TAMs can directly inhibit T-cell activation and function, prevent their capacity to reach cancer cells, and promote their terminal exhaustion (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, in other contexts, macrophages can support T cell&#x02013;mediated tumor control by producing chemokines that recruit effector T cells and by expressing costimulatory molecules (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Similarly, monocytes were recently identified as effective APCs supporting T cell&#x02013;mediated antitumor immunity in certain inflammatory settings (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, the roles of TAMs in cancer are highly variable. A deeper understanding of TAM diversity and function in the context of specific tumor types and stages is crucial for developing therapies that harness their beneficial functions while counteracting their tumor-promoting activities.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>DCs: Orchestrators of Cancer Immunity</title><p>DCs play a key role in cancer immunity by priming and coordinating T-cell antitumor responses. Distinct DC populations can infiltrate the TME, including conventional DCs (cDC), inflammatory type-3 DCs [DC3, also known as monocyte-derived DCs (moDC)] and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC). cDCs arise from common DC precursors and are subdivided in two categories with distinct developmental programs and functions: type-1 cDCs (cDC1) and type-2 cDCs (cDC2). cDC1s represent a phenotypically homogeneous population that is particularly important for antitumor immunity as they have unique capacities for antigen processing and cross-presentation, enabling efficient priming of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN; refs. <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Moreover, cDC1s are main sources of CXCR3 chemokine ligands (CXCL9/CXCL10), which are critical to recruit T cells into tumor lesions and position them for strategic interactions (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Indeed, intratumoral immune hubs in which cDC1s and other APCs accumulate have been recently identified as important supporting niches for effector T cells (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In contrast to cDC1s, cDC2s are much more heterogeneous, and their role in cancer is less understood (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), although recent studies suggest that they contribute to antitumor immunity (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Inflammatory DC3s also infiltrate tumors in which they share phenotypic markers with cDC2s such as CD11b or SIRP&#x003b1; (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that CD301b<sup>+</sup> moDCs mediate resistance to radiotherapy via induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the TME (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). However, the roles of DC3/moDCs in cancer immunity and immunotherapy remain partially understood (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Finally, pDCs are found in a variety of tumors and represent a main source of type I IFNs, which have a variety of antitumoral functions. However, the production of type I IFNs by pDCs is often impaired in the TME (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>), and conversely, pDCs can support immunosuppression via ICOS-dependent stimulation of Tregs (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), showing their mixed roles in cancer immunity.</p><p>DCs can adopt different functional states in the TME, which further expands their heterogeneity (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Typically, DCs mature after capturing antigens or following exposure to pathogen/damage signals. Mature DCs express high levels of MHC and costimulatory molecules and release cytokines and chemokines important for T-cell activation and function. They also express the chemokine receptor CCR7 which allows them to migrate to TDLNs. In the recent years, single-cell profiling studies have enabled the identification of a specific DC maturation state that could arise in both cDC1s and cDC2s in the TME (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). This conserved program of activation is characterized by the dual expression of molecules associated with DC maturation (<italic toggle="yes">CD40</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">IL12B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CCR7</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">LAMP3</italic>) and immunoregulation (<italic toggle="yes">CD274</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PDCD1LG2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CCL17</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CCL22</italic>) and has been variously referred to as &#x0201c;mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;LAMP3<sup>+</sup> DCs,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs.&#x0201d; In this review, we will refer to these cells as CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs.</p><p>Because of the dual nature of the CCR7<sup>+</sup> DC program, it is unclear whether it supports or restricts antitumor immunity. On the one hand, CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs prime tumor-specific T cells in TDLNs (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and produce IL12 and IL15, which are key cytokines for effector T-cell activity (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Accordingly, the presence of CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs has been associated with improved patient survival and successful immunotherapy responses in various cancer types (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). However, CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs also express high levels of the PD-1 ligands <italic toggle="yes">CD274</italic> (PD-L1) and <italic toggle="yes">PDCD1LG2</italic> (PD-L2), which directly inhibit T cells (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>), and they express high levels of <italic toggle="yes">CCL17</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CCL22</italic>, which encode major chemo-attractants for Tregs (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). In line with this, some studies reported that CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs support T-cell immunosuppression (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Therefore, understanding when and how CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs support or inhibit antitumor immunity will be crucial for designing more effective therapies. Beyond the CCR7<sup>+</sup> DC functional state, other activated CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cDC1 and cDC2 states have been identified in mouse models of tumor regression (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), and states of DC &#x0201c;hyperactivation,&#x0201d; which refer to the ability of DCs to elicit inflammasome-dependent activities, have also been described in response to certain stimuli (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). These findings highlight the complexity of DC function in cancer and underscore the need to better understand their functional states to harness their full potential for immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Granulocytes: Underexplored Players in Cancer Immunity</title><p>Granulocytes, a major group of evolutionarily conserved innate immune cells, play complex and less explored roles in cancer when compared with macrophages and DCs. Neutrophils infiltrate the TME and expand systemically during cancer, with their abundance generally linked to poor prognosis (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) can support cancer progression through various mechanisms, including releasing of neutrophil extracellular traps (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>), promoting tumor angiogenesis (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>), suppressing immune responses (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), and facilitating metastasis (<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). However, TANs can also restrict tumor growth by producing reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>), neutrophil elastases (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>), and nitric oxide (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>) and promoting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Additionally, neutrophils can contribute to antitumor immunity by supporting T cells (<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Furthermore, they have been recently shown to contribute to the success of cancer immunotherapies (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), and they can eradicate various tumors when appropriately stimulated in mice (<xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). This dual nature makes neutrophils functionally diverse, similarly to macrophages.</p><p>To better understand the diverse roles of neutrophils in cancer, increasing efforts aim to characterize their heterogeneity. Early classification systems proposed a dual polarization nomenclature mirroring TAMs (<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>), with TGF&#x003b2;-independent &#x0201c;N1&#x0201d; neutrophils being antitumoral and TGF&#x003b2;-dependent &#x0201c;N2&#x0201d; neutrophils being protumoral. A second approach aimed to categorize them based on a density gradient, with low-density neutrophils being immature and immunosuppressive and high-density neutrophils being mature and antitumoral (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Others identified protumoral TANs based on the expression of specific molecular markers such as SiglecF (<xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>), LOX-1 (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>), or FATP2 (<xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). However, these strategies are unlikely to capture the broad diversity of cancer-associated neutrophils (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Indeed, recent single-cell studies have revealed significant heterogeneity among neutrophils during cancer (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). Moreover, neutrophil function differs depending on anatomic location (<xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>), tumor stages (<xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>), and microanatomic localization within the TME (<xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). For instance, TANs accumulating in tumor hypoxic niches harbor a proangiogenic phenotype in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (<xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). Overall, a better understanding of the mechanisms governing neutrophil maturation, plasticity, and function will be key to leverage them for therapeutic purposes.</p><p>Beyond neutrophils, other granulocytes&#x02014;including eosinophils, basophils and mast cells&#x02014;also infiltrate the TME, but their roles in cancer are less defined. Eosinophils can support antitumor immunity by acting in concert with T cells (<xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>) and supporting responses to ICB (<xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Treatment with ICB leads to IL5 production by CD4 T cells and type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), promoting eosinophil production and expansion, which in turn stimulate T-cell antitumor responses in the TME (<xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>, <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Whereas several studies suggest a beneficial role for eosinophils, other studies reported protumoral activities (<xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>, <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>), showing that eosinophils could have opposing roles, akin to neutrophils. Less data are available on the phenotype of eosinophils during cancer, which is likely due to their specific cellular features that challenge their analysis with single-cell transcriptomic methods. In contrast, mast cells are well retained in single-cell RNA sequencing studies (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>).

Moreover, CCL2 promotes the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells into tumors (<xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). Given these roles, the CCL2&#x02013;CCR2 axis emerged as a promising target for limiting the infiltration of protumoral myeloid cell populations in the TME, leading to the development of several blocking agents, including anti-CCL2 and anti-CCR2 (Supplementary Table S1). However, these therapeutic candidates have failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical efficacy. Some of the potential explanations for their limited activity include redundant pathways for monocyte recruitment, paradoxical induction of tumor angiogenesis (<xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>), and compensatory increase of pathogenic neutrophils within tumors (<xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>).</p><p>Other key chemokine axes involved in myeloid cell recruitment into tumors include CCL5&#x02013;CCR5 and CXCL12&#x02013;CXCR4.

The anti-CCR5 leronlimab is currently being investigated for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (Supplementary Table S1), with preliminary results indicating safety and potential therapeutic benefits (<xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>).

Major limitations include the lack of specificity of chemokine pathways for distinct myeloid cell populations, as well as the biological redundancy among chemokine signaling networks. These challenges suggest that targeting individual chemokine pathways may have limited translation potential. However, a more integrated approach&#x02014;cotargeting complementary pathways or combining chemokine blockade with other myeloid- or lymphoid-directed therapies&#x02014;could enhance the effectiveness of these strategies and improve clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>CSF-1/CSF-1R blockade: promise, challenges, and lessons learned</title><p>The colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and its receptor (CSF-1R) play a critical role in the differentiation, recruitment, proliferation, and survival of monocytes and macrophages (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). For these reasons, blockade of CSF-1R or its ligand CSF-1 has been widely explored as a strategy to reduce the abundance of protumoral TAMs.</p><p>Preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibiting the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis induces antitumor activity in multiple mouse tumor models (<xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>, <xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>) and improves the efficacy of other cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and ICB (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>). Mechanistically, the effects of CSF-1/CSF-1R blockade vary by tumor type, either depleting TAMs or reprograming them toward an antitumoral phenotype. For instance, in brain tumors, CSF-1/CSF-1R blockade has been shown to reprogram TAMs toward an antitumoral phenotype without evidence of cell depletion (<xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>), In contrast, CSF-1 blockade significantly reduces TAM numbers in breast cancer models (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In addition, recent studies indicate that anti&#x02013;CSF-1R enhances type I IFN signaling in the TME (<xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>), fostering a more inflamed milieu and favoring antitumor immunity.</p><p>Building on these compelling preclinical studies, several antibodies targeting CSF-1 or CSF-1R were developed and tested in patients with cancer (Supplementary Table S2). Unfortunately, these therapies have shown disappointing results, with most of them having manageable safety profiles but limited clinical efficacy, either as monotherapies or in combination with other treatments (<xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>). One noticeable exception concerns tenosynovial giant cell tumors, a rare cancer type driven by aberrant expression of CSF-1, in which CSF-1/CSF-1R blockade has demonstrated significant efficacy (<xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). However, in most other malignancies, therapeutic responses induced by CSF-1/CSF-1R&#x02013;targeting agents are not clinically meaningful.

As a result, enthusiasm for targeting this pathway has waned in recent years. Development of acquired resistance to CSF-1/CSF-1R blockade may also contribute to the limited efficacy observed. In mouse models, the persistence of TAM subsets with immunosuppressive properties (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and compensatory expansion of Tregs and/or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (<xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>, <xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>) have been identified as major barriers to successful therapy. Additionally, whether anti&#x02013;CSF-1R antibodies require Fc effector function for optimal activity remains unknown.

The interactions between CD47 and SIRP&#x003b1; play a crucial role in preventing macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of normal cells, including red blood cells and hematopoietic stem cells (<xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>, <xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>).

As a result, targeting the CD47/SIRP&#x003b1; axis has emerged as an attractive way to boost the function of myeloid cells, especially macrophages, within the TME (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Strategies targeting the CD47/SIRP&#x003b1; pathway. <bold>A,</bold> First-generation antibodies designed to block CD47 promote phagocytosis of tumor cells, but they also target normal CD47-expressing cells, including RBCs, leading to significant on-target toxicity. <bold>B,</bold> To mitigate these toxic effects, next-generation anti-CD47 and SIRP&#x003b1; Fc-fusion molecules have been developed to selectively target specific glycoforms or clustered conformations of CD47 on tumor cells, thereby reducing binding to RBCs and normal cells.

Collectively, these findings have catalyzed the development of several human therapeutic agents, including anti-CD47 and anti-SIRP&#x003b1;, as well as SIRP&#x003b1; decoy receptors (Supplementary Table S3). Despite encouraging preclinical data, the results of the first clinical trials have revealed significant challenges for the clinical implementation of this approach (<xref rid="bib150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>). First, the ubiquitous expression of CD47 on normal cells, which acts as an &#x0201c;antigen sink,&#x0201d; prevents optimal drug delivery at tumor sites. Moreover, anti-CD47 antibodies induce significant off-tumor on-target toxicities, such as anemia and thrombocytopenia, because of CD47 expression on red blood cells and platelets. These adverse effects thus limit the maximum tolerating dose of anti-CD47 antibodies, and as such, their therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>Another key challenge involves the role of the antibody Fc domain in modulating the efficacy and toxicity of anti-CD47. Clinical studies have shown that antibodies with Fc domains that have weak or null binding to Fc &#x003b3; receptors (Fc&#x003b3;R), such as IgG4 or Fc-null IgG1, respectively, were relatively safe but ineffective as monotherapies (Supplementary Table S3). These anti-CD47 antibodies have shown clinical benefit only when combined with tumor-targeting antibodies that engage Fc&#x003b3;Rs, such as rituximab (<xref rid="bib151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). This suggests that sole blockade of CD47&#x02013;SIRP&#x003b1; interactions may not be sufficient to induce antitumor activity and that concomitant activating signals, such as engagement of Fc&#x003b3;Rs, might be required. In support to this, recent preclinical studies using humanized mouse models have revealed the critical role of Fc&#x02013;Fc&#x003b3;R interactions in the antitumor activity of human anti-CD47 (<xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>). In this system, Fc-enhanced anti-CD47 exhibited superior antitumor activity compared with other clinically tested Fc-null antibodies, albeit to the cost of increased toxicity, suggesting that local drug delivery (i.e., intratumoral administration) could be required to bypass toxicity issues.</p><p>Overall, the therapeutic targeting of the CD47/SIRP&#x003b1; axis in the clinic is more complex than initially anticipated. Nonetheless, several strategies are currently being investigated to overcome these challenges, offering hope for a successful translation into clinical practice. These strategies include the following: (i) antibody formats that selectively target CD47 on cancer cells (<xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>, <xref rid="bib154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>), (ii) bispecific antibodies that cotarget CD47 with tumor antigens or immunomodulatory receptors (<xref rid="bib155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>), and (iii) antibodies targeting SIRP&#x003b1;, which displays a safer expression profile as compared with CD47 (<xref rid="bib156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>Optimizing CD40 agonism: overcoming toxicity and boosting antitumor efficacy</title><p>CD40 is a costimulatory receptor that is expressed on APCs, including DCs, macrophages, and B cells (<xref rid="bib159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>).

Accordingly, anti-LILRB1 antibodies have been shown to enhance macrophage-mediated phagocytosis (<xref rid="bib188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>, <xref rid="bib189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>), and anti-LILRB2 therapy can repolarize tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells toward an immunostimulatory state (<xref rid="bib190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>, <xref rid="bib191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>). Encouraged by these preclinical findings, human anti-LILRB1 and anti-LILRB2, as well as LILRB1/2 fusion proteins, have been developed and are currently evaluated in multiple clinical trials (Supplementary Table S6). More recently, LILRB4 (ILT3) was also identified as a negative regulator of macrophages in tumors and a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (<xref rid="bib192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the therapeutic targeting of LILRB family members is only emerging in the clinic. As described for agents targeting Siglecs and their ligands, the promising preclinical findings may translate into effective clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="s5-7"><title>Targeting the adenosine pathway to reverse tumor immunosuppression</title><p>Another strategy to modulate myeloid cells in the TME is to inhibit their capacity to produce immunosuppressive factors. Adenosine has appeared as a major detrimental metabolite promoting tumor growth by maintaining myeloid cells in a protumoral state and by inhibiting tumor-reactive T cells (<xref rid="bib193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>). Adenosine production is mediated by the sequential activity of two ectonucleotidases: CD39 and CD73. Whereas the expression of these enzymes is not restricted to myeloid cells in the TME, they represent critical expression sites (<xref rid="bib194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>, <xref rid="bib195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>), and the therapeutic targeting of CD39 and CD73 is expected to alleviate tumor immunosuppression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Strategies targeting the adenosine pathway. <bold>A,</bold> Adenosine is a potent immunosuppressive metabolite found at high concentrations in the TME. Its production involves the sequential conversion of extracellular ATP into AMP and then into adenosine, which is mediated by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, respectively. In the TME, CD39 and CD73 are expressed by various cell populations, including myeloid cells. <bold>B,</bold> Antibodies targeting CD39 are being developed to block the initial step of adenosine production. <bold>C,</bold> Anti-CD39 antibodies with Fc-active [wild-type (WT) IgG1] or Fc-enhanced (afucosylated IgG1) domains, which engage activating Fc&#x003b3;Rs, are being developed to amplify antitumor responses by inducing depletion of CD39-expressing cells in addition to CD39 enzymatic inhibition. <bold>D</bold> and <bold>E,</bold> Similarly, anti-CD73 antibodies are under development with either Fc-active or Fc-null domains to optimally deplete or engage myeloid cells, tailoring their activity to specific therapeutic contexts.

Interestingly, anti-CD73 antibodies require Fc&#x003b3;R engagement for maximal therapeutic efficacy in some tumor models (<xref rid="bib197" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>, <xref rid="bib199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>), and a recent preclinical study revealed that Fc-enhanced anti-CD39 therapy induces antitumor activity by depleting immunosuppressive TAMs (<xref rid="bib200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>). These studies suggest that blockade of the enzymatic activity of CD39/CD73 could provide benefits in certain settings, but Fc-dependent depletion of CD39- and CD73-expressing myeloid cells could be required in other instances.</p><p>Overall, targeting the adenosine pathway has emerged as a promising approach to stimulate antitumor immunity, and a multitude of anti-CD39 and anti-CD73 antibodies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials (Supplementary Table S7). Whereas early studies suggest that these drugs are safe and exert on-target activity, clear evidence of antitumor activity has yet to be established (<xref rid="bib201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>, <xref rid="bib202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>). This suggests that the therapeutic targeting of the adenosine pathway could be more complex than expected and may likely require combination strategies to achieve significant therapeutic benefits in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s5-8"><title>TREM2, CLEVER-1, and IL4 receptor-&#x003b1;: new arrivals into the myeloid cell therapeutic landscape</title><p>Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), common lymphatic endothelial and vascular endothelial receptor 1 (CLEVER-1, also known as stabilin-1), and IL4 receptor-&#x003b1; (IL4R&#x003b1;) have recently emerged as regulators of myeloid cell function during cancer. Whereas their precise roles in myeloid and other cells remain incompletely understood, these molecules represent exciting therapeutic targets to reprogram immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhance antitumor immunity.</p><p>TREM2 is predominantly expressed on TRMs, including alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells, and microglia, and has been extensively studied in the context of Alzheimer disease (<xref rid="bib203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>). More recently, TREM2 has been identified as a marker of TAMs with potent immunosuppressive functions (<xref rid="bib204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>). Moreover, genetic deletion of <italic toggle="yes">Trem2</italic> in murine models reprograms the immunosuppressive properties of the myeloid compartment, resulting in enhanced antitumor immunity and reduced tumor growth (<xref rid="bib204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>). These results have sparked the development of antibodies targeting TREM2, which can reprogram TAMs, enhance T-cell antitumor activity, and improve sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in mouse preclinical models (<xref rid="bib204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>). Notably, afucosylated anti-TREM2 antibodies&#x02014;which display enhanced Fc effector function&#x02014;have been shown to deplete immunosuppressive TREM2<sup>+</sup> TAMs (<xref rid="bib207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>). Based on these promising preclinical results, two human anti-TREM2 agents, EOS-215 and the afucosylated IgG1 PY314, have advanced into clinical trials. Recently published results indicated that PY314 failed to overcome resistance to ICB in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (<xref rid="bib208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>). However, the combination of anti-TREM2 with PD-1 blockade could still show synergistic activity in ICB-na&#x000ef;ve settings.</p><p>CLEVER-1 was originally identified as a receptor expressed on endothelial cells, but later studies found that it was also expressed on TRMs (<xref rid="bib209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>). During cancer, CLEVER-1 is upregulated in TAMs and supports immune tolerance (<xref rid="bib210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>). In mouse preclinical models, anti-CLEVER-1 antibodies were shown to reprogram TAMs, resulting in enhanced T-cell antitumor immunity and improved response to PD-1 blockade (<xref rid="bib210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>), which provided a rationale for moving anti&#x02013;CLEVER-1 to the clinic. Recently, bexmarilimab, a human Fc-null IgG4 antibody targeting CLEVER-1, has shown encouraging activity in patients (<xref rid="bib211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>). Indeed, bexmarilimab monotherapy was well tolerated and induced disease control in a subset of patients with late-stage cancer with evidence of TAM reprogramming at the tumor site. Overall, anti&#x02013;CLEVER-1 holds clinical promise for converting ICB nonresponding patients into responders by reshaping the tumor myeloid landscape.</p><p>The type-2 cytokine IL4 has recently been implicated in the induction of immunosuppressive myeloid cells during cancer (<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). In tumor-bearing mice, IL4 produced by basophils and eosinophils was shown to reprogram myeloid cell progenitors in the bone marrow, ultimately expanding the pool of immunosuppressive cells at the tumor site. Based on these observations, the antibody dupilumab&#x02014;which is an anti-IL4R&#x003b1; approved for allergic diseases&#x02014;has been repositioned for use in oncology with the goal of reversing tumor-induced immunosuppressive myelopoiesis (<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). This strategy is reminiscent of prior attempts to target proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1&#x003b1; and IL1&#x003b2;, which can also promote tumor-supportive myeloid phenotypes (<xref rid="bib212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>). For example, IL1&#x003b1; has been shown to reprogram bone marrow&#x02013;resident and intratumoral myeloid cells (<xref rid="bib212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>, <xref rid="bib213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>), whereas IL1&#x003b2; has been identified to promote protumoral cross-talk between TAMs and cancer cells, particularly in pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="bib214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>). However, clinical trials of antibodies targeting IL1&#x003b1; (bermekimab), IL1&#x003b2; (canakinumab), or the IL1R accessory protein IL1RAP (CAN04) have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit (Supplementary Table S8), highlighting some challenges in the targeting of these pathways. Upcoming results of the clinical trials studying dupilumab in oncology will determine whether blockade of the IL4 pathway will yield better therapeutic outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Strides have been made in our understanding of myeloid cell ontogeny, functional plasticity, and their pivotal roles in shaping cancer immunity. These insights have not only clarified why some early attempts to target myeloid cells for cancer immunotherapy fell short but also inspired a new wave of innovative therapeutic approaches. Some of these new strategies focus on inhibiting protumoral, immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations, whereas others aim to stimulate beneficial populations with antitumoral activities.</p><p>However, further research is required to understand how factors such as tumor stage, tumor location, and interactions with other immune cells influence the phenotypic profile and function of myeloid cells within the TME. This knowledge will be crucial for developing more effective therapies that can be successfully translated into the clinic. Furthermore, these strategies are expected to complement and enhance T cell&#x02013;based immunotherapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Although only a few of these strategies have shown promise thus far, and many have been discontinued because of lack of efficacy or toxicity concerns, these challenges highlight the complexity of manipulating myeloid cells in patients. Unlike antibodies targeting T cells, myeloid cell targeting may require more sophisticated approaches&#x02014;such as local drug delivery, bispecific antibodies, and Fc-engineering&#x02014;to ensure treatment safety and efficacy. As such, the next generation of myeloid cell&#x02013;targeting antibody-based therapies holds the potential to significantly advance clinical outcomes in patients with cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, whereas the therapeutic targeting of myeloid cells continues to generate excitement, much work remains to be done. A deeper understanding of cancer-induced myeloid cell reprogramming, along with the development of safe and effective treatment strategies, will be essential to harness the full potential of myeloid cells for cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><caption><p>File contains tables S1 to S8.</p></caption><media xlink:href="cir-25-0159_supplementary_tables_suppsf1-sf8.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all the members of the Jeffrey V.
