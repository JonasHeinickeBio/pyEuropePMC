Tumor cells acquire elaborate biological strategies to evade immune surveillance, often by manipulating their metabolic programs to establish an immunosuppressive niche that facilitates their proliferation and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This metabolic reprogramming fulfills dual biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands to support cancer cell proliferation but also profoundly impacts immune cell functionality, shaping the overall immune response within the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. One of the most notable metabolic adaptations in tumor cells is the &#x0201c;Warburg effect&#x0201d;, characterized by a preference for aerobic glycolysis even when sufficient oxygen is available, enabling them to rapidly generate energy and biosynthetic intermediates that support their uncontrolled proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">The intricate relationship between metabolic sensing and functional fate in immune cells holds a pivotal position in shaping their behavior. Various immune cell types display significant heterogeneity in their metabolic profiles. Competitive nutrient uptake between malignant and immune cells, as well as progressive accumulation of metabolic byproducts in the TME, collectively alters immune cell metabolic activity and effector capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The metabolic fitness of immune cells directly determines their capacity for immune surveillance and tumor elimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Immunometabolism, an emerging interdisciplinary field, delves into the functional modulation of immune cells through their metabolic circuitry, providing new insights into the dynamic triad of immunity, metabolism, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recent advances in this field have highlighted therapeutic opportunities through regulating metabolic pathways to boost anticancer immune responses. Reprogramming metabolic fitness of immune cells could reverse immunosuppression, enhance the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies, and enable the development of novel combination therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">This review seeks to offer a thorough examination of the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, the roles of key metabolic pathways and enzymes in immune regulation, and the implications of these findings for cancer immunotherapy. We will explore the complex metabolic interplay between cancer cells and immune cells, and discuss how targeting immunometabolic checkpoints can enhance antitumor immunity. Additionally, we will highlight the potential of innovative technologies, including single-cell metabolomics and spatial metabolomics, to advance our comprehension of immunometabolism and guide precision medicine frameworks in onco-immunology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Metabolic reprogramming of immune cells</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Dissecting principal metabolic pathways</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Glycolysis</title><p id="Par55">Glycolysis is a central metabolic pathway that critically influences immune cell function and fate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Naive T cells primarily meet their energy demands through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Upon activation of CD8<sup>&#x02009;+</sup>&#x02009;T cells, a metabolic shift toward glycolysis occurs, which is further amplified by the synergistic co-stimulatory effects of CD28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This enhanced glycolytic activity supports the subsequent expansion and differentiation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into short-lived effector cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, glycolysis hinders the longevity and establishment of immune memory function in memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, increased glycolysis promotes their differentiation towards Th17/Th1 subtypes while concurrently impeding their transition into regulatory T cells (Tregs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Decreased glycolysis in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells enhances the immunosuppressive capacity of Tregs and boosts the immune memory function of CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Natural killer (NK) cells also exhibit dynamic metabolic regulation during their development and activation. Generally, quiescent or steady NK cells exhibit low metabolic demand and depend on OXPHOS for homeostasts. Following activation, these cells significantly increase glycolysis and OXPHOS flux to satisfy the high-energy requirements and molecular synthesis necessary for their functional activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Inhibition of glycolysis compromises NK cell function, reducing the secretion of interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; and granzyme B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 1 serves as a central metabolic regulator maintaining NK cell function. Restricting mTORC1 signaling impairs glucose uptake in activated NK cells, ultimately compromising NK cell effector function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Dendritic cells (DCs) also greatly depend on glycolysis for their maturation, activation, and functional execution. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling induces glycolytic reprogramming, which equips DCs with the necessary energy and molecular building blocks for activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Suppression of glycolysis at the onset of activation negatively impacts the viability and functional capabilities of these activated DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], highlighting the indispensable regulatory function of glycolysis in DC immunocompetence. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) also exhibit marked upregulation of glycolytic genes. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin can lower the glycolytic activity in MDSCs and decrease their immunosuppressive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Phosphoenolpyruvate, a key intermediate in glycolysis, has been reported to exert antioxidant effects by preventing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting MDSC survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Collectively, these findings emphasize the pivotal role of glycolytic pathways in governing immune cell fate and function. Modulating glycolysis in immune cells represents a promising strategy for controlling tumor immunity and warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic target.</p><p id="Par56">
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Metabolic reprogramming in the TME. Center: Tumor cells predominantly utilize glycolysis for glucose metabolism, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, resulting in lactate production. They increase fatty acid uptake and synthesis to maintain membrane stability and energy supply, while adjusting amino acid metabolism to support protein synthesis and signaling, with glutamine playing a key role in the TCA cycle for carbon and nitrogen supply. Tumor cells can shift to OXPHOS based on oxygen and nutrient availability. Metabolites such as lactate, adenosine, and ROS produced by tumor cells can reshape the TME to promote immune evasion. Periphery: Immune cells exhibit dynamic metabolic adaptations in the TME. Effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells shift to glycolysis, whereas memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells rely on FAO. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells use glycolysis for Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation, while Tregs and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells depend on OXPHOS and FAO. B cells increase glycolysis and OXPHOS upon activation. NK cells upregulate glycolysis and OXPHOS during activation, with mTORC1 playing a central role. MDSCs predominantly rely on glycolysis, especially in hypoxic conditions. Activation of DCs requires glycolytic reprogramming, which is essential for their maturation and function. M1 macrophages primarily rely on glycolysis with impaired TCA cycle and OXPHOS, while M2 macrophages depend on the TCA cycle and OXPHOS. Metabolic manipulation can convert M2 to an antitumor M1 phenotype. In response to TME stress, neutrophils adjust their metabolism, including increased glycolysis and ROS production, contributing to NETs formation.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle</title><p id="Par57">Pyruvate derived from glycolysis is transformed into acetyl-CoA and enters the TCA cycle in mitochondria, where it supports OXPHOS through the generation of reducing equivalents. Beyond energy production, the TCA cycle profoundly influences immune cell function through metabolic intermediates and epigenetic regulators (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For example, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enhances Th1 cell terminal effector function, while inhibiting their proliferation and histone acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. On the other hand, the malate-aspartate shuttle and mitochondrial citrate export sustain aspartate production, supporting Th1 cell expansion and histone acetylation, while selectively regulating gene expression related to T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Alpha-ketoglutarate (&#x003b1;-KG) can suppress the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs by promoting OXPHOS, fatty acid synthesis (FAS), and triglyceride storage, while simultaneously enhancing Th1 cell maturation and cytokine secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, &#x003b1;-KG, as a co-substrate of &#x003b1;-KG dependent dioxygenases, is crucial for the function of histone and DNA demethylases, whereas succinate and fumarate can suppress the activity of these enzymes, thereby affecting gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The ratio of succinate to &#x003b1;-KG enhances pro-inflammatory gene expression and promotes the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The migratory competence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells relies on TCA cycle activity, with ATP and ROS generated within the mitochondria serving as indispensable mediators for T cell migration and infiltration into tumor tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, targeting mitochondrial metabolism to improve CAR-T cell penetration into tumors may offer an encouraging therapeutic strategy. Additionally, ketone bodies, particularly &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate, serve as the main substrate for acetyl-CoA production in the TCA cycle of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and can also optimize T cell effector responses by modulating histone acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">

</p><p id="Par59">Macrophage function and polarization are closely associated with the TCA cycle. Typically, M1 macrophages predominantly utilize aerobic glycolysis, accompanied by compromised TCA cycle and OXPHOS, whereas M2 macrophages rely on the TCA cycle and OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Moreover, &#x003b1;KG promotes the demethylation of histone H3K27me3 on the promoters of M2 macrophage-specific genes in a JMJD3-dependent manner by acting as a cofactor for JMJD3, which is a histone demethylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This demethylation process is necessary for the expression of M2 genes and the subsequent activation of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, succinate acts as a competitive inhibitor of JMJD3. An elevated &#x003b1;KG/succinate ratio in macrophages alleviates succinate-mediated inhibition of JMJD3, thereby enhancing H3K27me3 demethylation and driving M2 polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In addition to macrophages, other immune cells also depend on the TCA cycle for their metabolic demands. NK cells require exogenous pyruvate to support TCA cycle, which is essential for maintaining their effector functions, signaling, and cellular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In MDSCs, the &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling enhances glutamine consumption and itaconate production. This process suppresses mitochondrial ROS generation, consequently increasing MDSC resistance to doxorubicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Overall, the evidence underscores the critical influence of the TCA cycle in shaping immunometabolism, epigenetic regulation, and functional outcomes, highlighting its potential as a strategic intervention point in cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>OXPHOS</title><p id="Par60">OXPHOS is the final common pathway of cellular metabolism, driven by electron transfer from NADH and FADH&#x02082; to oxygen, resulting in ATP production and water formation. It primarily occurs in mitochondria and works in coordination with glycolysis and the TCA cycle to satisfy cellular energy needs. OXPHOS critically regulates immune cell function, proliferation, activation, and antitumor immunity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Naive T cells exhibit low energy demands, predominantly depending on TCA cycle and OXPHOS for their metabolic needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Dysfunction of cytochrome c oxidase reduces the availability of acetyl-CoA, thereby impairing both OXPHOS and TCA cycle, and limiting the proliferation and activation of naive T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Compared to naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Th17 cells exhibit elevated OXPHOS activity to support survival and effector function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Besides, Tregs primarily depend on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and OXPHOS as their major metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which facilitates the maintenance of their immunoregulatory activity and functional integrity in nutrient-limited environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Notably, enhancing OXPHOS to reprogram cellular metabolism has become a potential approach for revitalizing terminally exhausted T cells, thus enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Similar to T cells, B cells exhibit diverse metabolic features based on their activation status and specific functional needs. Naive B cells exhibit low metabolic activity, which is rapidly enhanced through increased glycolysis and OXPHOS upon antigen activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Long-lived memory B cells display a metabolically quiescent state with moderate OXPHOS activity, whereas plasma cells, due to their requirement for antibody production and secretion, typically consume more glucose and engage in glycolysis and OXPHOS to meet their energy demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">M1 macrophages exhibit impaired OXPHOS, partly due to NO-mediated mitochondrial inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In contrast, M2 macrophages depend on OXPHOS. Modulating macrophage metabolism can shift their phenotype. Research suggests that delivery of mitochondria from M1 macrophages coated with mannosylated polyethyleneimine to M2 macrophages reprograms their metabolism from OXPHOS to glycolysis, shifting them to an antitumor M1 state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In comparison to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that have not phagocytosed tumor cells, phagocytic TAMs exhibit increased transcription of OXPHOS-related genes, elevated mitochondrial content, and enhanced oxygen utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Similarly, phagocytic DCs show a transition from classical DC1s (cDC1s) to mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDCs), accompanied by enhanced OXPHOS and the development of an immunosuppressive phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. These characteristics are closely associated with their tumor-promoting functions. Finally, OXPHOS is essential for the functionality of NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Docosahexaenoic acid, IL-2, and IL-15 promote OXPHOS, thereby augmenting the functional responses of NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In contrast, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; impairs mitochondrial metabolism and OXPHOS, leading to compromised NK cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In summary, OXPHOS critically influences the metabolic landscapes of various immune cells. Manipulating OXPHOS and related metabolic pathways represents a promising approach for boosting antitumor immunity and modulating immune responses in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>FAO and FAS</title><p id="Par62">Fatty acid metabolism is crucial for lipid homeostasis and significantly impacts tumor development and immune cell function (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

FAO is an aerobic mitochondrial process that generates energy through the breakdown of fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], whereas FAS encompasses a set of enzymatic reactions that convert acetyl-CoA into long-chain fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Research indicates that FAS provides necessary energy for the expansion and differentiation of effector T cells following antigen stimulation, while FAO actively contributes to Tregs differentiation and memory T cell production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells store lipids, particularly triglycerides, to fuel FAO, which sustains mitochondrial function and enhances the immediate reactivity to antigen stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Under low-glucose and hypoxic TME, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enhance the catabolic metabolism of fatty acids, which allows them to sustain effector functions within the challenging tumor milieu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, in obesity-related TME, an increase in FAO driven by STAT3 inhibits CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector cell function, thus accelerating tumor growth, especially in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. This illustrates that fatty acid metabolism may exert diametrically opposing effects in different metabolic TMEs. Chronic tumor antigen exposure drives T cell exhaustion&#x02014;marked by upregulated inhibitory receptors that profoundly reshape T cell metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. PD-1 activation impairs glycolysis and amino acid metabolism in T cells while promoting FAO through upregulation of the key enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) and enhanced lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This metabolic shift promotes the survival of T cells as long-lived cells but may also limit their effector function. In CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibiting elevated PD-1 levels, there is a significant increase in lipid uptake and content, along with increased expression of the scavenger receptor CD36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. CD36 not only mediates the uptake of fatty acids by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but also induces lipoperoxidation and ferroptosis, resulting in decreased expression of cytotoxic cytokines and compromised antitumor capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par63">The phenotypic transition of monocytes and macrophages is closely linked to fatty acid metabolism. Monocytes with elevated intracellular fatty acid levels, especially those expressing higher levels of fatty acid synthetic enzymes, are more prone to differentiate into macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Conversely, inhibiting FAS in macrophages results in more monocyte-like characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Within tumors, MDSCs exhibit increased FAO activity, accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, activation of pivotal FAO enzymes, and a higher rate of oxygen utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. NK cells also show elevated fatty acid uptake and high levels of CPT1, a key enzyme in long-chain fatty acid oxidation. By enhancing FAO, the metabolic adaptability of NK cells can be improved, thereby providing potential for improving NK cell-based immunotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. These findings demonstrate the complex role of fatty acid metabolism within tumors. While it supports the survival and functionality of immune cells, under specific conditions, it can also facilitate tumor progression. A comprehensive understanding of how fatty acid metabolism shapes the TME furnishes a robust scientific basis for the evolution of innovative metabolic-targeted therapeutic strategies, presenting encouraging avenues for enhancing cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Functions and implications of metabolic enzymes</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Core enzymes in glycolysis</title><p id="Par64">Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, primarily responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In T cell biology, the absence of HK2 impairs effector T cell function, consequently dampening anticancer immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Notably, NF-&#x003ba;B-inducing kinase regulates T cell metabolism by preventing lysosomal degradation of HK2, which plays a role in avoiding CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion and optimizing adoptive cell therapeutic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The purinergic receptor P2Y12 stabilizes HK2 by modulating PI3K/Akt signaling and suppressing lysosomal degradation, thereby promoting T cell activation and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. HK2 also regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thereby promoting IL-1&#x003b2; production through a caspase-1-dependent pathway, which contributes to modulating immune cell inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Furthermore, immune checkpoints can also regulate the expression of HK2. Tim-3 suppresses the expression of HK2 in macrophages via the STAT1 pathway, leading to reduced production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In non-small cell lung cancer, PD-L1-induced HK2 upregulation is inversely correlated with T cell effector gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Besides its impact on immune cells, HK2 also exerts a vital influence on tumor cells, influencing their metabolic rewiring and immune evasion mechanisms. Enhanced HK2 expression in tumor cells promotes phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, leading to NF-&#x003ba;B pathway activation and increased PD-L1 expression, thereby enhancing tumor immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. These findings suggest the promise of combining HK2 inhibitors with PD-1 monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment. Furthermore, targeting HK2 in tumor cells suppresses aerobic glycolysis, reduces the accumulation of immunosuppressive metabolites such as lactate, alleviates the suppression of immune cell functions, and offers a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">Phosphofructokinase 1, a pivotal rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, is frequently overexpressed in various cancers and correlates with poor patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Specifically, phosphofructokinase 1 platelet isoform (PFKP) promotes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. In turn, VEGF enhances PFKP activity, collectively driving tumor angiogenesis and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Additionally, PFKP upregulates PD-L1 expression in glioblastoma cells by augmenting EGFR activation, thereby facilitating tumor immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Ganetespib has been reported to suppress both PFKP and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), leading to reduced tumor glycolysis. This reduction promotes cytotoxic T cell infiltration via the suppression of glycolysis-dependent IL-8 signaling, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Preclinical models have demonstrated that targeting PFKP significantly inhibits tumor progression, suggesting its promise as a therapeutic candidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Notably, genetically engineering T cells to express critical metabolic enzymes such as phosphofructokinase and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) enhances cytokine secretion, upregulates T cell activation markers, increases glycolytic capacity, and demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy in human tumor xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">PKM2 is a splice isoform of pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, in which phosphoenolpyruvate is converted into pyruvate, accompanied by ATP generation. Within tumor cells, PKM2 predominantly exists as a low-activity dimeric form, which promotes metabolic reprogramming characterized by enhanced aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS, thereby supplying both biosynthetic precursors and energy to support tumor cell proliferation and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. PKM2 serves as a key regulator of immunometabolism within the TME. Tumor-derived PKM2 interacts with integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> on macrophages to activate the integrin-focal adhesion kinase-PI3K signaling axis, thereby suppressing phosphatase and tensin homolog expression and upregulating arginase 1 expression, which promotes M2 macrophage polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Targeting PKM2 disrupts this interaction, shifts M2 macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, and enhances antitumor immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Moreover, PKM2 enhances PD-L1 expression through activation of the GATA3 pathway in cancer cells while simultaneously suppressing PD-L2 expression, representing a dual regulatory mechanism contributing to immune escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Interestingly, PKM2 also exerts immunostimulatory effects under certain contexts. Its activation in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CAR-T cells enhances mitochondrial function via modulation of one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation, resulting in improved antitumor activity and memory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. PKM2 agonists have been shown to potentiate both adoptive cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), while reducing intratumoral Treg infiltration, highlighting their therapeutic potential in cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Core enzymes in amino acid metabolism</title><p id="Par67">Glutaminase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, representing the pivotal step underlying the &#x0201c;glutamine addiction&#x0201d; of tumor cells. By competitively depleting glutamine, tumor cells inhibit the activation and expansion of CD8&#x0207a; T cells, establishing a characteristic &#x0201c;metabolic tug-of-war&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. In mouse tumor models, tumor cell-specific deletion of glutaminase significantly restores CD8&#x0207a; T cell function and delays tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Glutaminase also regulates CD4&#x0207a; T cell differentiation: inhibition of glutaminase promotes Th1 differentiation and upregulates IFN-&#x003b3; secretion, thus promoting antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Preclinical studies have further revealed that glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 enhances the cytotoxic function of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes against cancer cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. In vivo, CB-839 in combination with ICB markedly increases effector T cell infiltration and boosts the response to immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Based on these findings, CB-839 has advanced into multiple clinical trials. In combination with nivolumab, early clinical evidence reveals encouraging synergistic antitumor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Moreover, glutaminase inhibitors target glutamine metabolism, while mTOR inhibitors (such as everolimus and sapanisertib) block glucose metabolism. The combination of these two approaches simultaneously disrupts both the energy supply and biosynthetic pathways in tumor cells, resulting in synergistic antitumor effects. This intervention has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Arginase is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine to produce ornithine and urea. In the TME, the expression of arginase can be significantly upregulated, particularly in TAMs, MDSCs and polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes, and this upregulation is key to shaping an immunosuppressive TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. The depletion of local L-arginine by arginase limits the proliferation and functional activity of T and NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Arginase has been found to reduce the expression of CD3&#x003b6; and &#x003b5; chains, essential components of the TCR signaling, consequently compromising T cell functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. In addition, elevated levels of arginase1 correlate with the polarization of TAMs towards an M2-like state, which exhibits stronger immunosuppressive properties and exacerbates immune escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Deletion of arginase 1 in myeloid cells reshapes the TME, improves CD8&#x0207a; T cell function, and slows tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. In multiple murine tumor models, targeting arginase 1 not only enhances CD8&#x0207a; T cell infiltration but also improves the response to PD-1 ICB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. The arginase-1-based peptide vaccine represents a novel immunotherapeutic strategy that restores L-arginine levels in the TME by targeting and eliminating arginase-1-expressing immunosuppressive cells, thereby promoting T cell activation and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. Early-phase clinical trial results demonstrate that this vaccine is well tolerated, capable of inducing antigen-specific immune responses, and shows preliminary clinical efficacy in a subset of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, consists of a catalytic subunit GCLC and a regulatory subunit GCLM. Together with glutathione synthetase, GCL regulates GSH synthesis and cellular redox homeostasis, contributing to tumor cell survival, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Additionally, GCL profoundly influences the functional state of immune cells. In the TME, tumor cells competitively uptake cystine by overexpressing solute carrier family 7 member 11, leading to cystine deprivation in T cells. This disrupts the GSH synthesis pathway in T cells, resulting in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation accumulation, ultimately inducing T cell exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. Overexpression of GCLC can restore GSH synthesis within T cells, inhibit CD36-mediated lipid uptake, and thereby enhance antitumor immune [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. Moreover, tumor cells maintain high GCL activity to support GSH synthesis, alleviating ROS-mediated damage and promoting metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. In contrast, inhibition of GCL can reduce circulating tumor cells and diminish the metastatic potential of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. In colorectal cancer, the loss of the GCLM competitively inhibits NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, thereby enhancing tumor cell sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. However, in glioblastoma, inhibition of GCLC prompts tumor cells to upregulate glutaminase and other glutamine-utilizing enzymes, thereby activating de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. This adaptive compensatory mechanism suggests that combined targeting of GCLC and glutamine metabolism could offer a promising therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Core enzymes in fatty acid metabolism</title><p id="Par70">CPTs are pivotal enzymes of FAO, comprising four distinct members: CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, and CPT2. These isoforms exhibit significant differences in tissue distribution and catalytic activity. Members of the CPT1 family are primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where they catalyze the formation of acylcarnitines; in contrast, CPT2 is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the conversion of acylcarnitines back into acyl-CoA, thereby promoting mitochondrial FAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. All CPT isoforms are involved in tumor metabolic reprogramming and exert essential functions in cancer progression. Research has revealed that CPT2 functions as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation being correlated with the development of multiple cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>].

Specifically, CPT1A is highly expressed in cancer stem cells, where it catalyzes the succinylation of mitochondrial fission factor via its lysine succinyltransferase activity, thereby activating sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and driving lipid desaturation to maintain stemness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. Moreover, CPT1A collaborates with L-carnitine sourced from TAMs to establish a CPT1A/c-Myc positive feedback loop within cancer stem cells, activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/glutathione peroxidase 4 axis and reducing lipid peroxidation, thereby suppressing ferroptosis and impairing CD8&#x0207a; T cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; secreted by T cells induces CPT1A-mediated FAO in tumor cells through an AMPK-dependent pathway, generating pro-survival signals that enable resistance to immune attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. Targeting CPT1A restores ferroptosis sensitivity, enhances antitumor immunity, and improves immunotherapy outcomes. Particularly in ErbB2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer models, CPT1A suppression not only curbs tumor progression but also fosters an immunostimulatory microenvironment that potentiates anti-HER2 therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>].</p><p id="Par71">Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a key metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, a rate-limiting step in FAS. ACC exists as two major isoforms: ACC1, which predominantly participates in cytosolic lipid biosynthesis, and ACC2, which is situated at the outer mitochondrial membrane and inhibits FAO by blocking CPT1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>].

However, ACC1 demonstrates a multifaceted role in T cell biology and functions in a context-dependent manner. In a T cell-specific ACC1 knockout mouse model, CD8&#x0207a; T cells exhibit impaired homeostatic proliferation and reduced expansion upon in vitro stimulation. These defects can be rescued by exogenous fatty acid supplementation, highlighting an essential role for ACC1-driven FAS in CD8&#x0207a; T cell expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Conversely, ACC1 deletion induces memory cell fate in CD4&#x0207a; T cells, a phenomenon associated with enhanced FAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. In the TME, CD8&#x0207a; T cells display elevated ACC1 expression, leading to lipid accumulation and metabolic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Inhibition of ACC1 restores FAO capacity in CD8&#x0207a; T cells, enhances ATP production, and improves both stemness and persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. These metabolic interventions significantly boost antitumor immune responses, suggesting that targeting ACC1 could be an effective means to potentiate cancer immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par72">SCD-1 is an integral protein embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and facilitates the transformation of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>].

These products act as essential precursors for the biosynthesis of various lipids. SCD-1 is upregulated in human cancers, where it contributes to tumor initiation, progression, stemness, and chemoresistance by modulating lipid metabolism and signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]. Inactivation of SCD-1 enhances the differentiation of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells toward effector phenotypes, promoting IFN-&#x003b3; production and cytotoxic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. The mechanisms by which SCD-1 inhibition boosts the anticancer capabilities of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be understood from both direct and indirect perspectives. From a direct perspective, targeting SCD-1 augments the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by lowering cellular oleic acid levels and esterified cholesterol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. Indirectly, SCD-1 inhibition promotes CCL4 production by suppressing Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in tumor cells and reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress in CD8&#x0207a; T cells, thereby enhancing DC recruitment and antitumor T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. Furthermore, SCD-1 upregulation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upregulates Th1-associated markers like TBX21, IL-2, and IFN-&#x003b3;, whereas its inhibition results in elevated levels of Treg-specific markers, including FOXP3 and TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>].

Emerging evidence highlights an essential role of ME2 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. ME2 depletion disrupts the TCA cycle in these cells, resulting in elevated intracellular levels of the metabolic intermediate fumarate. Fumarate impedes tuberous sclerosis complex 2/mTORC1 signaling pathway by inhibiting death associated protein kinase 1, thereby suppressing the activation and cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. Furthermore, overexpression of ME1 promotes the activation and expansion of CD8&#x0207a; T cells, partly through the type I IFN pathway. It further enhances the metabolic adaptation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, while maintaining redox homeostasis to prevent the accumulation of excess ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. Compared to memory, effector, and progenitor exhausted T cells, exhausted T cells exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced OXPHOS metabolism, leading to a decreased NAD/NADH ratio and ammonia accumulation within the exhausted T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>].

Furthermore, MEs critically regulate cancer cell growth, cell cycle progression, and redox homeostasis. ME2 not only maintains the protein stability of mutant p53 by sustaining the levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), thereby promoting tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>], but also accelerates cell cycle dynamics and tumor cell expansion through &#x003b1;-KG-mediated transcription of cyclin D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. Additionally, Akt1 induces a metabolic shift of the mitochondrial TCA cycle to glycolysis through phosphorylation of cytoplasmic ME2 at serine 9, which leads to tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. Moreover, NADPH generated by ME metabolism not only serves as a key component in cellular antioxidant systems to support rapid tumor proliferation, but also directly interacts with histone deacetylase 3, disrupting its association with the co-activator nuclear receptor corepressor and thereby impairing histone deacetylase 3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. This leads to increased histone acetylation, a modification that typically leads to a more open chromatin structure, enabling transcription factor recruitment and the activation of genes such as GLUT4. Enhanced expression of GLUT4 boosts glucose uptake and glycolytic capacity, further supporting tumor cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. Moreover, NADPH produced by MEs metabolism can directly interact with and suppress HDAC3 activity, thereby regulating the epigenetic state of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>].

This reaction bridges glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and is vital for sustaining cellular bioenergetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1) is an atypical Ser/Thr kinase that inhibits PDHC activity by phosphorylating the E1&#x003b1; subunit of PDHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. This inhibition impairs pyruvate metabolism to acetyl-CoA, consequently decreasing acetyl-CoA flux into the the TCA cycle and downregulating OXPHOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. PDHK1 serves as a key regulator of energy metabolism. In cancer cells, overexpression of PDHK1 redirects cellular metabolism toward glycolysis and increases lactate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. The buildup of lactate and the resulting acidic environment enhance the expression of arginase1 in macrophages, subsequently restraining the expansion and activation of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. Additionally, in T cells, TCR activation enhances PDHK1 activity, redirecting pyruvate metabolism from the TCA cycle to glycolysis, which is crucial for T cells to rapidly respond to external stimuli and synthesize cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. Aberrant activation or overexpression of PDHK1 has been observed in a range of malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. PDHK1 inhibitors, such as dichloroacetate (DCA), can redirect pyruvate metabolism from glycolysis back to the TCA cycle.

PRPS is a key regulator of cellular metabolism, with its activity being essential for cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. PRPS1 has been found to be aberrantly overexpressed in tumors, where it facilitates malignant progression by enhancing oncogenic traits such as proliferation and migration, and by evading apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. Additionally, O-GlcNAc modification of PRPS1 promotes tumorigenesis and contributes to resistance against radiotherapy and chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. PRPS2 bypasses ADP/GDP feedback inhibition to sustain ATP overproduction, directly stabilizes MAT2A to accelerate S-adenosylmethionine synthesis and m6A RNA methylation, and thereby drives lung tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. The absence of PRPS2 leads to elevated NADPH levels in lymphoma cells, triggering reductive stress-mediated cell death, suggesting its potential role in modulating oxidative balance and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase catalyzes the conversion from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to phosphoribosylamine, which is the first step in purine ring formation. In tumors, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase expression is significantly upregulated, enhancing de novo purine biosynthesis and promoting cell proliferation and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. The role of key enzymes in purine metabolism as drivers of carcinogenesis is well-established; however, the intricate mechanisms by which they sculpt the function of immune cells, and the metabolic-immune crosstalk implicated in immune surveillance and antitumor responses, remain elusive and warrant profound investigation. Deciphering this interaction is poised to lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of tumor immunoregulation and to create opportunities for the identification of novel therapeutic targets in future immunotherapeutic approaches.</p><p id="Par76">Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme located on the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The dependence of cancer cells on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis for rapid growth underscores the essential role of DHODH in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. Research has shown that inhibition of DHODH induces ferroptosis in tumor cells by disrupting CDP-choline-dependent lipid metabolism and promotes CD8&#x0207a; T cell infiltration, enhancing the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. Additionally, DHODH inhibition increases cancer cell antigen presentation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of ICB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) is a key enzyme in the salvage pathway for pyrimidine nucleotides, primarily responsible for converting uridine and cytidine into their corresponding monophosphate forms: UMP and CMP. UCK2 has been identified as a key player in multiple cancers, driving tumor growth and resistance to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>]. UCK2 has also been recognized as a potential biomarker of the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and its downregulation not only induces cell cycle arrest but also enhances tumor cell susceptibility to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. Cytidine deaminase is another crucial enzyme involved in pyrimidine metabolism, catalyzing the hydrolytic deamination of cytidine and deoxycytidine to produce uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively. In immunotherapy-resistant tumors, high expression of cytidine deaminase increases extracellular UDP levels, which further bind to P2Y6 receptors on TAMs, promoting the formation of an immunosuppressive environment and affecting the effectiveness of antitumor immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">In summary, metabolic enzymes within the TME play pivotal roles by mediating metabolic competition and crosstalk between tumor and immune cells, as well as regulating the differentiation and function of immune cells. Targeting these key enzymes holds promise for amplifying antitumor immune responses, with potential synergistic effects when combined with ICB.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Metabolites as central modulators of immune responses</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Glucose</title><p id="Par79">Glucose, as a central source of cellular energy metabolism, plays multifaceted roles in the TME. First, it is involved in the competition for limited nutrients between tumor cells and immune cells, as well as among immune cells themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>]. Second, the accumulation of intermediate and end products derived from glucose metabolism may exert suppressive effects on immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression and functional regulation of glucose transporters exhibit significant differences among various immune cells, which in turn influence their metabolic activities and effector functions. Lastly, abnormal glucose metabolism may also promote tumor immune evasion through multiple mechanisms, thereby weakening antitumor immune responses.</p><p id="Par80">The uptake of glucose is primarily mediated by two families of transporters: glucose transporter/solute carrier 2&#x000a0;A (GLUT/SLC2A) and sodium-dependent glucose transporter/solute carrier 5&#x000a0;A (SGLT/SLC5A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. These transporters exhibit distinct expression patterns and functional roles across various immune cell populations. GLUT1 is recognized as the principal glucose transporter that facilitates glucose uptake and metabolism in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, critically contributing to their activation, proliferation, and effector functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>]. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells rely primarily on GLUT10 for their activation and antitumor immune capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. However, lactate accumulation within the TME compromises GLUT10 functionality, thereby impeding glucose uptake in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and consequently dampening their cytotoxic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. Restoring GLUT10 function or mitigating lactate accumulation may represent potential approaches to enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. DCs also utilize GLUT1 for extracellular glucose uptake, with GLUT1 expression being upregulated during DC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. Recent studies have highlighted GLUT1 as a reliable target for antigen delivery to DCs. For instance, J. Liu et al. developed a novel glycosylated nanovaccine that binds to GLUT1 on DCs, facilitating antigen delivery and presentation, DC maturation, and antitumor immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. Furthermore, macrophage polarization is influenced by glucose metabolism, particularly through the expression of SLC2A3. Elevated SLC2A3 levels contribute to the transition of macrophages toward the M2 subtype, a phenotype correlated with immune suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. Additionally, NK cells benefit from increased expression of SLC2A1, which enhances their capacity to utilize glucose for ATP and pyruvate production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. This metabolic adaptation promotes glycolysis and OXPHOS, bolstering NK cell-mediated immunity through increased cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>]. While both tumor and immune cells depend on glucose, they exhibit differential preferences for glucose transporter isoforms. Tumor cells predominantly express GLUT1, whereas immune cells favor GLUT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. In Tregs, GLUT3-mediated glucose metabolism enhances the O-GlcNAc modification of cellular proteins, which induces a tumor-associated gene expression profile and thereby maintains immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>]. Inhibiting GLUT1 in cancer cells redirects their metabolic pathways from glycolysis to OXPHOS, leading to elevated ROS levels. Elevated ROS levels may increase tumor cell vulnerability to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated bystander killing by reducing c-FLIP, a principal suppressor of TNF-&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>]. Exploiting this metabolic vulnerability offers a potential therapeutic avenue for augmenting antitumor immunity.</p><p id="Par81">Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown a strong link between malignant tumors and hyperglycemia as well as diabetes. On one hand, patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes are at significantly higher risk for developing various cancers, which is closely connected to unfavorable outcomes. On the other hand, certain tumors can directly cause hyperglycemia and diabetes, a phenomenon referred to as tumor-associated hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia exerts multifaceted impacts on the TME, not only promoting tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion but also enhancing tumor immune evasion through multiple mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>]. Research indicates that hyperglycemia can suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function by upregulating PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. The underlying mechanisms include the following: high glucose concentrations downregulate PTRH1 via EGFR-RAS signaling activation, thereby enhancing PD-L1 mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>]. Additionally, high glucose stimulates HK2 release from mitochondria, facilitates I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation at T291, and enhances its interaction with &#x000b5;-calpain, resulting in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; degradation and NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated upregulation of PD-L1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Although anti-PD-1 therapy shows efficacy in some cancers, the overall response rate remains suboptimal. Studies have shown that IFN&#x003b1; reduces glucose consumption in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by inhibiting FosB transcription and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)&#x02212;1&#x003b1; signaling pathways, creating a high-glucose environment and expanding the pool of effector CD27<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which subsequently improves the response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>]. Furthermore, hyperglycemia can also induce a Warburg effect in V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cells, causing lactate accumulation that impairs cytolytic machinery trafficking to the V&#x003b3;9V&#x003b4;2 T cell-tumor synapse, thereby inhibiting cytotoxic molecule secretion and antitumor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Diabetic mouse tumor models have revealed differences in the immune landscape of the TME under normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. Compared with non-diabetic mice, tumors in diabetic breast cancer mice are larger and exhibit distinct characteristics, including collagen remodeling, enhanced M2 TAM infiltration, and rapid metastatic dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. Mechanistically, hyperglycemia promotes extracellular matrix glycation, leading to increased TME stiffness, which in turn activates mechanotransduction signaling to enhance tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>]. Notably, M2 TAMs possess the highest intratumoral glucose uptake capacity among immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>]. Enhanced glucose metabolism in these cells elevates Cathepsin B O-GlcNAcylation, thereby promoting the generation of mature Cathepsin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>]. Cathepsin B facilitates tumor progression and metastasis by degrading extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins, and contributes to chemoresistance by protecting cancer cells from apoptosis and stimulating the generation of inflammatory IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">205</xref>]. Moreover, glucose also enhances the immunosuppressive role of monocyte-derived macrophages through histone lactylation of lysine residues, leading to increased IL-10 production and suppressed T cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">206</xref>]. To address these challenges, researchers have created an innovative material system (glucose-PEO-b-PLLA-TEMPO), encapsulating the clinical drug CUDC-101 and photosensitizer IR780. This system re-educates TAMs, successfully converting immunosuppressive &#x0201c;cold&#x0201d; tumors into immunoresponsive &#x0201c;hot&#x0201d; tumors, providing an innovative strategy for efficient tumor treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>]. Additionally, metformin, a diabetes medication showing promising anticancer activity, normalizes blood glucose levels and reshapes the TME, boosting the therapeutic outcomes of cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Amino acid</title><p id="Par83">As critical constituents of cellular architecture and essential energy sources, amino acids are crucial for supporting cell growth, differentiation, and function. Beyond their role in protein synthesis, amino acids have a pivotal influence on regulating immune response through multiple mechanisms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These processes provide both energy and biomass, facilitating metabolic reprogramming upon immune cell activation to facilitate proliferation, differentiation and functional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">209</xref>]. There are nine essential amino acids that must be acquired through the diet. Under conditions of high proliferation and metabolism, certain non-essential amino acids can also become conditionally essential, requiring their uptake from the extracellular environment. Consequently, the transport of amino acids mediated by specific amino acid transporters is crucial for regulating immune cell function.

</p><p id="Par85">Immune cells dynamically regulate the expression of amino acid transporters in response to antigen stimulation, thereby remodeling amino acid metabolism and activating their functional programs. For example, proteomic analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reveals marked upregulation of the transporters SLC1A5 and SLC7A5 in antigen-activated CTLs compared to naive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>]. The absence of glutamine transporter ASCT2 hinders the development of Th1 and Th17 cells and reduces inflammatory T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">211</xref>]. Macrophages in a resting state rely on arginine supplied by the amino acid transporter SLC7A1/CAT1 to meet cellular metabolic demands. However, during activation, arginine uptake via SLC7A2/CAT2 becomes essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref>]. Additionally, SLC38A2-mediated glutamine transport is essential for cDC1s activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>], while the cystine transporter SLC7A11 negatively regulates efferocytosis in DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>].</p><p id="Par86">Glutamine functions as a precursor for a multitude of metabolic pathways. For instance, it supplies &#x003b1;-KG to the TCA cycle through glutamate, thereby supporting cellular biosynthesis and functional activities. Glutamine is essential for T cell activation and the production of IL-2 or IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref>]. Glutamine deprivation inhibits the synthesis of cytokines and hampers the expansion of Th1 and Th17 cells, while promoting the development of Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">218</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms underlying glutamine-induced differentiation of T cells into different subtypes vary. Along the glutamine-glutamate-&#x003b1;KG-TCA metabolic axis, glutamate promotes Th17 differentiation by inhibiting ROS, whereas &#x003b1;-KG drives Th1 and CTL differentiation through chromatin modifications and subsequent inhibition of IL-2-mediated mTORC1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]. Therefore, Th17 cells respond more rapidly to glutamine and glutamate metabolic signals, being affected earlier, while Th1 and CTL responses occur at a later stage. Additionally, glutamine is indispensable for the metabolism and functional capacity of NK cells; however, its mode of action is independent of glutaminolysis. Instead, glutamine predominantly serves as a signaling molecule that sustains cMyc expression, thereby controlling NK cell metabolic programming and effector function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Within the TME, tumor cells exhibit high glutamine consumption, which restricts its supply to infiltrating T cells and cDC1s, which in turn hinders their anticancer effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>]. Intratumoral glutamine supplementation can enhance cDC1-mediated antitumor immune responses and overcome resistance to immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>]. Additionally, studies have shown that inhibition of glutamine metabolism suppresses tumor proliferation while impairing MDSC expansion and recruitment, which correlates with reduced expression of tumor-derived colony-stimulating factor 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>]. Moreover, targeting glutamine metabolism within MDSCs induces activation-dependent apoptosis and their reprogramming into inflammatory macrophages, thereby enhancing antitumor immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>]. The findings reveal that glutamine metabolism exerts intricate regulatory effects on immunity, indicating a delicate balance. On one hand, supplementing glutamine can enhance the functionality of immune cells, thus inhibiting tumor progression. On the other hand, inhibiting glutamine metabolism can reduce tumor cell metabolic demands while decreasing the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, ultimately enhancing antitumor immunity. This dual mechanism suggests that in cancer treatment, it is necessary to precisely modulate glutamine metabolism based on the specific features of the tumor to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.</p><p id="Par87">Serine, a non-essential amino acid, can be synthesized in the body from glycine and 3-phosphoglycerate. It serves not only as a key substrate for the production of various essential biomolecules, including glycine, cysteine, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, neurotransmitters, and phospholipids, but also plays a pivotal role in methylation reactions, thereby influencing the synthesis of proteins and DNA. These metabolic activities are crucial for maintaining the function, expansion, differentiation, and antioxidant defense mechanisms of immune cells. Studies have shown that activated T cells significantly upregulate enzymes involved in the serine, glycine, and one-carbon metabolic network, rapidly converting serine into one-carbon units to support rapid T cell proliferation. Notably, despite adequate glucose levels capable of supporting T cell stimulation and energy production, extracellular serine is still an indispensable factor for optimal T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">221</xref>]. Moreover, serine metabolism is also of significant importance to Tregs. High concentrations of serine within the TME enhance the accumulation of Tregs via sphinganine-mediated regulation of c-Fos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222">222</xref>]. Glutathione restricts the availability of serine to maintain the immunosuppressive properties of Tregs. Glutathione deficiency enhances serine metabolism in Tregs, increases its uptake and synthesis, thereby strengthening one-carbon metabolism, activating the mTOR signaling pathway, and downregulating FOXP3 expression, which weakens the immunosuppressive capacity of Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223">223</xref>]. Serine deprivation in cancer cells results in mitochondrial dysfunction and cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial DNA. This subsequently activates the cGAS-STING pathway, induces a type I IFN response, and enhances immune cell infiltration in tumors, suggesting that serine may function as an inhibitor of anticancer immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR224">224</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225">225</xref>]. Furthermore, serine metabolism coordinates macrophage polarization. Deficiency in serine metabolism increases insulin-like growth factor 1 expression by decreasing the promoter abundance of S-adenosyl methionine-dependent histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Insulin-like growth factor 1 then activates the p38-dependent JAK-STAT1 signaling to promote M1 polarization and suppress STAT6-mediated M2 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">226</xref>]. Additionally, serine deficiency reduces IL-1&#x003b2; synthesis in M1 macrophages through inhibition of mTOR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">227</xref>]. This mechanism highlights the critical role of serine in regulating immune cell function.</p><p id="Par88">Methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, fulfills a vital function in protein synthesis and serves as a precursor for S-adenosylmethionine, a central methyl donor involved in the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and phospholipids. Tumor cells have been shown to elevate methionine transporter expression, promoting increased methionine uptake and consequently lowering its levels in the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">229</xref>]. Methionine scarcity can result in decreased dimethylation at lysine 79 of histone H3 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, subsequently suppressing STAT5 expression and weakening T cell immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">230</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">231</xref>]. However, some research indicates that methionine restriction may promote anticancer immune responses by inhibiting the activity of the methyltransferase SUV39H1 in cancer cells, boosting the activation of cGAS and type I IFN signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">232</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">233</xref>]. Additionally, S-adenosylmethionine promotes N6-methyladenosine modifications in immune checkpoint molecules in tumor cells, thereby increasing the expression of immune checkpoints like PD-L1 and VISTA, leading to immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>]. Notably, dietary methionine restriction both restores CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in the TME and disrupts tumor cell one-carbon metabolism, affecting redox balance and nucleotide synthesis, making tumor cells more sensitive to antimetabolites or radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>]. Methionine can be metabolized into homocysteine within the body, which can further be converted into cysteine. For T cells, the uptake of cystine (the oxidized form of cysteine, where two cysteine molecules are linked by a disulfide bond) or cysteine is crucial for their activation, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">236</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">237</xref>]. However, T cells lack cystathionase and cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine, nor can they import and reduce cystine due to an incomplete xc&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;transport system. Instead, they rely on antigen-presenting cells to supply cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">238</xref>]. MDSCs, which lack the ASC transporter, compete with antigen-presenting cells for cystine uptake but cannot release cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">238</xref>], resulting in cysteine depletion within the TME and subsequent suppression of T cell activity.</p><p id="Par89">Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid that is critically involved in various metabolic pathways, including the urea cycle, polyamine synthesis, NO production, and immune regulation. The presence of L-arginine critically influences the potency of antitumor T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>]. Increased intracellular L-arginine levels promote a metabolic shift in activated T cells from glycolysis dependence to mitochondrial OXPHOS, and maintain T cells in a central memory-like state rather than further differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>]. This metabolic adaptability and memory-like phenotype confer greater persistence and antitumor efficacy to T cells. Low arginine levels (20 &#x000b5;M) can induce metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming in T cells through the ATF4-SLC7A11-GSH axis, leading activated T cells to acquire immunosuppressive properties similar to Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>]. However, tumor cells often deplete arginine to inhibit T cell proliferation, thereby weakening antitumor immune responses. Additionally, myeloid cells within the TME competitively take up arginine via SLC7A1/SLC7A2 and SLC7A6/SLC7A7 transporters while secreting elevated ornithine, establishing a metabolic environment characterized by high ornithine and low arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">243</xref>]. This metabolic imbalance suppresses T cell growth, signaling, and antitumor activity, ultimately diminishing the response to ICB therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Furthermore, different macrophage subtypes play distinct roles in arginine metabolism. M1 macrophages rely on inducible nitric oxide synthase to metabolize arginine into NO, which inhibits tumor progression and enhances T cell immune activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>]. In contrast, M2 macrophages express arginase 1, fostering an anti-inflammatory microenvironment, inhibiting T cell function, and promoting tumor growth through arginine metabolites such as ornithine and polyamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>]. Given the pivotal function of arginine in tumor immunity, arginine supplementation has been investigated as a potential therapeutic approach to enhance anticancer immune responses. In this context, a genetically engineered probiotic strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 has been designed to colonize tumors and transform metabolic byproduct in the TME into L-arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>]. The increased L-arginine levels enhance T cell infiltration and activation, improving immune conditions and synergizing strongly with PD-L1 blockade therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>]. However, the increase in arginine levels in the TME carries the potential risk of promoting tumor cell proliferation. To address this issue, strategies to enhance arginine metabolism specifically in T cells can be employed to optimize their antitumor capabilities. For example, CAR-T cells can be genetically engineered to express argininosuccinate synthetase 1 or ornithine transcarbamylase, thereby increasing their ability to resynthesize L-arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>]. This adaptation enables CAR-T cells to function effectively in low-arginine environments and enhances their antitumor potency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Fatty acid</title><p id="Par90">Fatty acids occupy a key position in immunometabolism, serving not only as crucial energy sources and structural components of cells, but also as active participants in signal transduction, gene expression regulation, and tumor immunity modulation. CD36, a fatty acid translocase ubiquitously present on cellular membranes, is pivotal in enhancing the uptake of exogenous fatty acids. Research has shown that CD36 significantly influences immune cell differentiation and activation, thereby shaping cell fate. Specifically, CD36-mediated ferroptosis inhibits the functionality of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and suppresses antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Additionally, the uptake of oxidized lipids via CD36 promotes lipid peroxidation and dysfunction in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Further studies have revealed that CD36 is specifically elevated in Tregs, acting as a principal metabolic regulator. Through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) &#x003b2; signaling, CD36 fine-tunes mitochondrial fitness, enabling Tregs to adjust to a lactate-enriched TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>]. Targeted deletion of CD36 in Tregs reduces the infiltration of intratumoral Tregs, enhances antitumor immune responses, and inhibits tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>]. Moreover, CD36 is involved in autophagy within B cells, and its deficiency leads to impaired humoral immunity, characterized by reduced plasma cell generation, proliferation, mitochondrial mobilization, and OXPHOS levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">247</xref>]. In TAMs, the upregulation of CD36 inhibits IFN-I signaling via p38 activation downstream of oxidized lipid signaling, closely linked to its immunosuppressive characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">248</xref>]. Myeloid-specific deletion of CD36 markedly impedes cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">248</xref>]. IL-34 triggers an increase in FAO through CD36, leading to the M2-like polarization of foam-like TAMs, which suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumor responses and facilitate immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">249</xref>]. Additionally, CD36-mediated lipid uptake enhances FAO in MDSCs, thereby promoting the formation of a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250">250</xref>]. This series of studies reveals the multifunctionality of CD36 across various immune cells and its significant effect on the TME, offering new avenues for the development of effective cancer treatments.</p><p id="Par91">Fatty acids can be categorized based on their chain length and degree of saturation into various types, including short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain fatty acids, as well as saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Different types of fatty acids exert significantly varied effects on immune cells. Short-chain fatty acids, specifically valerate and butyrate, enhance anticancer activity of CTLs and CAR-T cells by activating the mTOR pathway and suppressing histone deacetylases, thereby increasing the production of effector molecules such as CD25, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251">251</xref>]. Long-chain fatty acid palmitic acid disrupts mitochondrial activity through Akt/mTOR-mediated Ca&#x000b2;&#x0207a; flux, leading to T cell exhaustion and an increase in Tregs within the TME, thereby accelerating tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">252</xref>]. However, oleic acid can reverse the T cell exhaustion induced by palmitic acid, improving antitumor immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">252</xref>]. Oleic acid significantly contributes to the development of Tregs. In an environment lacking oleic acid, thymocytes express more ATP2A2, which enhances the calcium-NFAT1-FOXP3 axis, promoting the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>]. Moreover, oleic acid also induces M2 polarization of myeloid cells via the mTOR pathway, further promoting tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>]. Linoleic acid, another unsaturated fatty acid, exhibits complex and controversial effects on immune cell metabolism. On one hand, studies have shown that linoleic acid promotes mitochondrial ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, leading to apoptosis of naive T cells and decreased TNF-&#x003b1; expression, thus impairing antitumor T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">256</xref>]. On the other hand, research indicates that linoleic acid enhances the formation of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contacts, promoting calcium signaling and mitochondrial energetics, thereby enhancing effector functions, preventing exhaustion, and stimulating a memory-like phenotype in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR257">257</xref>]. These seemingly contradictory findings highlight the complexity of linoleic acid&#x02019;s impact on immune cells and underscore the need for further investigation into the specific contexts and conditions under which linoleic acid exerts its diverse effects. Understanding these nuances could provide valuable insights for developing more targeted and effective immunotherapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par92">Dietary trans-vaccenic acid, a long-chain fatty acid, is primarily found in the meat and dairy products of ruminant animals. Trans-vaccenic acid deactivates the immune-regulatory G protein-coupled receptor GPR43, thereby antagonizing its activation by short-chain fatty acids. This activates the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway to enhance the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258">258</xref>]. Dietary elaidic acid boosts MHC-I expression and antigen presentation in tumor cells through metabolism mediated by Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 5, thereby amplifying the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and offering potential to enhance cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">259</xref>]. These findings emphasize the significance of considering dietary fatty acid metabolism as a promising approach for improving cancer clinical treatments. In addition, fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) has a vital function in coordinating fatty acid transport and regulating cellular metabolism. FABP5 interacts with the cytoskeletal organizer transgelin 2 to promote lipid uptake, mitochondrial respiration, and cytotoxic capabilities in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">260</xref>]. Long-chain unsaturated fatty acids secreted by tumor cells activate PPAR&#x003b3; via FABP5, conferring immunosuppressive properties to TAMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR261">261</xref>]. Inhibition of FABP5 suppresses the production of inhibitory molecules in TAMs, which in turn enhances the effector function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262">262</xref>]. In summary, fatty acids influence immune cell functions through complex mechanisms, emphasizing their promise as therapeutic targets in tumor immunotherapy. Additional studies are required to explore these mechanisms in depth to optimize therapeutic strategies based on fatty acids.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Metabolic crosstalk between tumor cells and immune cells</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Metabolic characteristics of tumor cells</title><p id="Par93">In the TME, nutrient supply is often limited, prompting tumor cells to develop various metabolic adaptation mechanisms to ensure their survival and proliferation. To prioritize the acquisition of limited nutrients, tumor cells optimize resource utilization by enhancing specific metabolic pathways. For example, they may increase glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporters and maintain their glycolytic process even when blood glucose levels are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR263">263</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264">264</xref>]. In addition, tumor cells adjust amino acid metabolic pathways to ensure the supply of raw materials required for protein synthesis, particularly prioritizing the use of amino acids including glutamine and serine, which are crucial for cellular growth and DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">265</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">268</xref>]. Tumor cells also support their rapid proliferation through enhanced de novo FAS and increased uptake of exogenous lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR269">269</xref>]. These metabolic changes not only meet the demands of cell membrane synthesis but also regulate cellular signaling pathways through lipid metabolites. However, the demand for essential nutrients by cancer cells inevitably leads to a competitive relationship with immune cells. Specifically, the aggressive uptake of glutamine mediated by tumor cells results in glutamine deprivation in the TME, consequently reducing the effector functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR270">270</xref>].

Overall, the metabolic adaptations of tumor cells not only affect their own growth and proliferation but also regulate immune cell activity, thereby suppressing antitumor immune responses.

This metabolic preference leads to lactate accumulation within tumor cells, which is then released extracellularly through monocarboxylate transporters, leading to acidification of the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">278</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279">279</xref>]. Immune cells sense extracellular lactate, triggering intracellular signaling pathways that influence their functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">280</xref>]. Tregs capitalize on lactate metabolism to maintain their immunosuppressive functions and proliferative capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR281">281</xref>]. The transcription factor FOXP3 reconfigures the metabolic profile of Tregs to thrive in glucose-poor, lactate-rich conditions by enhancing OXPHOS, increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> oxidation, and inhibiting Myc and glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Lactate has demonstrated its ability to promote tumorigenesis through regulation of MOESIN lactylation and enhancement of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. Moreover, lactate increases the expression of CTLA-4 through RNA splicing, bolstering the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs and contributing to the efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Lactate has also been reported to inhibit the expansion and cytokine secretion of CTLs, diminishing their cytotoxic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR282">282</xref>].

The findings also suggest that lactate activates GPR81 in DCs, impairing tumor antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285">285</xref>], and inhibits the functions of invariant NKT cells through a phosphodiesterase-5 dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR286">286</xref>]. It also promotes the differentiation of M-MDSCs into G-MDSCs, thereby suppressing immune responses and facilitating tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR287">287</xref>]. In colorectal cancer liver metastasis, lactate-induced acidification impairs liver-resident NK cells&#x02019; ability to control internal pH levels, triggering mitochondrial stress and apoptosis, thus allowing tumors to evade immune surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">288</xref>]. Interestingly, the latest studies have uncovered an unconventional immunoprotective role for lactate in tumor immunity. The research suggests that lactate exerts differential effects on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells depending on the environmental pH. In an acidic milieu, lactate undermines the survival of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas in a neutral environment, it enhances the stemness of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, thus promoting antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289">289</xref>].

Their coordinated activity facilitates efficient lactate metabolism that underpins tumor growth and progression. As such, targeting LDHA and MCTs represents a compelling therapeutic approach in cancer therapy. Oxamate, a classical inhibitor of LDHA, has demonstrated potent antitumor effects across multiple malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR290">290</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR294">294</xref>].

In cancer immune responses, cDC1s have a pivotal function in the capture and transport of tumor antigens to draining lymph nodes, where they prime antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, this antitumor function can be compromised by PGE2. Specifically, PGE2 induces cDC1 dysfunction within tumors by activating the cAMP signaling pathway downstream of EP2 and EP4 receptors, thereby impairing their capacity to coordinate effective antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unlike cDC1s, which are responsible for cross-presenting antigens, inflammatory monocytes can acquire and present peptide-MHC class I complexes to T cells through a &#x0201c;cross-dressing&#x0201d; mechanism, playing a key role in intratumoral T cell stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>]. Nonetheless, hyperactivation of the MAPK signaling in tumor cells induces the release of PGE2 while simultaneously suppressing the generation of type I IFN, thus impeding this process and compromising the inflammatory monocyte state as well as intratumoral T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>]. It is noteworthy that in the TME, active inflammation coexists with immunosuppression, both contributing to tumor progression. PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling not only enhances active inflammation by activating NF-&#x003ba;B in myeloid cells but also induces immunosuppression by promoting the mregDCs-Tregs axis, which facilitates Treg recruitment and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">309</xref>]. Stem-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have a significant part in driving protective anticancer immunity by sustaining self-renewal and facilitating the differentiation of effector cells. While PGE2 does not influence the priming of stem-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in lymph nodes, it limits the intratumoral generation of both early and late effector T cells derived from these precursors by inhibiting the IL-2 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>]. Moreover, PGE2 suppresses IL-2 signaling in T cells by downregulating the IL-2R&#x003b3;c chain, which disrupts the formation of IL-2R&#x003b2;-IL2R&#x003b3;c membrane dimers and consequently leads to impaired IL-2-mTOR signaling, repression of PGC1&#x003b1; transcription, and ultimately induces oxidative stress and ferroptosis in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>].

In T cells, D-2HG uptake impairs cytotoxic activity and IFN-&#x003b3; signaling, resulting in compromised metabolism and diminished antitumor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR320">320</xref>]. In macrophages, following the uptake of D-2HG, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) translocates to the nucleus and drives the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;, thereby promoting an immunosuppressive phenotype that hinders T cell proliferation and effector function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR321">321</xref>]. Furthermore, D-2HG impairs the differentiation of DCs, downregulates MHC II expression, and reprograms their metabolism toward increased lactate production, collectively leading to a tolerogenic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR322">322</xref>]. In contrast to the immunosuppressive effects of D-2HG, L-2HG primarily enhances antitumor immune responses. Culturing T cells in the presence of L-2HG improves mitochondrial function and significantly enhances in vivo proliferation and cytotoxic activity in adoptive cell therapy models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323">323</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR324">324</xref>]. Likewise, L-2HG-treated macrophages exhibit increased chromatin accessibility and adopt a pro-inflammatory, antitumor phenotype, thereby sensitizing tumors to anti-PD-1 blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">325</xref>]. Targeting D-2HG represents a potential therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Ivosidenib, a selective inhibitor of mutant IDH1 that is approved for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, effectively reduces intratumoral D-2HG levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326">326</xref>]. Moreover, CD44 promotes NADPH production via the pentose phosphate pathway, which supports D-2HG synthesis by mutant IDH. Thus, combining IDH inhibitors with CD44 blockade has been shown to enhance tumor clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>]. Currently, several clinical trials targeting 2-HG are underway across various tumor types, including cholangiocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328">328</xref>], low grade glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR329">329</xref>], chondrosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR330">330</xref>], glioblastoma and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR331">331</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Succinate-mediated metabolic regulation</title><p id="Par100">Succinate is a critical intermediate of the TCA cycle, formed from succinyl-CoA via the catalytic activity of succinate synthase and subsequently oxidized to fumarate by SDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR332">332</xref>]. In recent years, succinate has increasingly been recognized for its role in mediating metabolic interactions between cancer cells and immune cells. T cells can readily absorb extracellular succinate, and elevated levels of succinate have been shown to inhibit glucose flux through the TCA cycle. In conjunction with activation of the succinate receptor SUCNR1, this results in compromised effector functions of CD4&#x0207a; and CD8&#x0207a; T cells, including diminished IFN-&#x003b3; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR333">333</xref>]. In innate immune cells, succinate exerts diverse immunoregulatory effects. It promotes M1 macrophage polarization by inducing succinylation of IDH2 and histone H3K122 at the LDHA promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR334">334</xref>]. Moreover, succinate influences thymic stromal lymphopoietin signaling to activate macrophages, enhancing type I IFN responses while inhibiting the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway to sustain M1 macrophage functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR335">335</xref>]. In DCs, succinate enhances antigen presentation by upregulating thymic stromal lymphopoietin and EGFR signaling, while concurrently suppressing the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR336">336</xref>]. However, recent evidence also implicates succinate in promoting tumor-supportive immune phenotypes. Tumor cells can release succinate into the TME, which activates the PI3K-HIF-1&#x003b1; signaling axis through SUCNR1, leading to M2 macrophage polarization and thereby promoting tumor progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337">337</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR338">338</xref>]. SDH is frequently deficient in tumor cells and represents a hallmark of several cancer types. Loss of SDH activity leads to succinate accumulation, which contributes to oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR339">339</xref>]. Succinate inhibits prolyl hydroxylase, thereby stabilizing HIF-1&#x003b1; and activating hypoxia-related signaling pathways, even under normoxic conditions. This pseudohypoxia state drives tumor angiogenesis and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR340">340</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR341">341</xref>]. Additionally, succinate facilitates metastasis via multiple mechanisms. It activates SUCNR1/PI3K/HIF-1&#x003b1; signaling to promote cancer cell migration while simultaneously suppressing ten-eleven translocation 2 activity, which leads to reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels, global DNA hypermethylation, and enhanced tumor aggressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337">337</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR342">342</xref>]. Targeting succinate metabolism represents a potential therapeutic strategy. Inhibition of succinate accumulation disrupts cancer cell stemness and impairs tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR343">343</xref>]. Given that most of the oncogenic effects of succinate are mediated by SUCNR1, targeting this receptor provides a potential intervention to suppress tumor progression and metastasis.

Within the TCA cycle, it is produced by SDH and subsequently converted to malate via fumarate hydratase. Under normal metabolic conditions, this conversion supports mitochondrial energy production and maintains cellular metabolic homeostasis. In the context of antitumor immunity, elevated intracellular fumarate levels have been shown to induce early mitochondrial morphological alterations and promote the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol via mitochondria-derived vesicles. This release activates the cGAS-STING signaling axis, leading to innate immune activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR344">344</xref>]. Regarding adaptive immunity, fumarate hydratase-deficient tumors accumulate fumarate, which directly modifies and inactivates ZAP70a critical kinase in TCR signalingby succinating cysteine residues (C96 and C102), thereby suppressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, expansion, and effector function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR345">345</xref>]. Similarly, in B cells, LYN is succinated by fumarate, theraby inhibiting BCR signaling and B cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR346">346</xref>]. These findings collectively indicate that fumarate acts as a metabolite that negatively regulates adaptive antitumor immune responses. Fumarate also exerts multifaceted effects on oncogenic signaling. Its buildup in tumor cells is frequently associated with inactivating mutations or downregulated expression of fumarate hydratase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347">347</xref>]. Elevated fumarate levels inhibit Tet-mediated demethylation of the antimetastatic miR-200ba429 cluster, thereby upregulating transcription factors associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR348">348</xref>]. Furthermore, fumarate-induced succinylation of prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta stabilizes the enzyme, enhances type I collagen production, and promotes tumor cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR349">349</xref>]. In addition, fumarate generated by adenylosuccinate lyase under hypoxia not only suppresses STING-mediated IFN signaling to promote immune evasion, but also inhibits Beclin1 demethylation, thereby enhancing autophagy and tumor cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350">350</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR351">351</xref>]. Moreover, fumarate induces succinylation of HIF-1&#x003b1; at cysteine 800, promoting its nuclear translocation, recruitment of the coactivator p300 and PKM2, and subsequent transcriptional activation of PD-L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR352">352</xref>]. This mechanism suggests that fumarate modulation could sensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy, providing a rationale for combining metabolic interventions with ICB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Immunometabolism and tumor metastasis</title><p id="Par102">During the process of tumor metastasis, the primary tumor releases a series of soluble factors, exosomes, or extracellular vesicles before spreading to distant organs. These substances can alter the local microenvironment of the distant target tissue, fostering a suitable setting for the establishment and growth of circulating cancer cells. This phenomenon is known as the formation of the pre-metastatic niche. Metabolic reprogramming holds significant importance in this process, particularly in the modulation of immune cell functions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It is reported that tumor-derived exosomes can induce macrophages in the pre-metastatic niche to develop an immunosuppressive phenotype marked by elevated PD-L1 expression and lactate metabolism, which is achieved through NF-kB-mediated, glycolysis-centric metabolic rewiring, consequently facilitating tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR353">353</xref>]. Furthermore, tumor cells release vesicles laden with long-chain fatty acids, which are taken up by metastasis-associated macrophages that highly express CD36. This uptake promotes macrophage polarization towards an M2 phenotype, subsequently inhibiting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function and facilitating tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR354">354</xref>].

Stress hormones induce neutrophils to release pro-inflammatory S100A8/A9 proteins, activating myeloperoxidase and causing the accumulation of oxidized lipids.

</p><p id="Par104">The metabolic reprogramming of neutrophils is closely associated with the formation of cancer-induced premetastatic niches and is one of the key factors driving the establishment of metastatic tumors. Research indicates that the protease cathepsin C secreted by tumor cells can enhance the recruitment of neutrophils to the pre-metastatic niche and induce NETosis, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which facilitate tumor metastasis and colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR356">356</xref>]. NETs are intricate mesh-like networks expelled from activated neutrophils, consisting of DNA, histones, and granular proteins. They can envelop circulating tumor cells, providing a physical barrier while resisting attacks from immune cells, thereby contributing to metastatic progression. For instance, in breast cancer, cancer cells activate the TLR3-IRF3 pathway to stimulate the production of hydroxyacid oxidase 1 in alveolar epithelial cells, causing an increase in oxalic acid levels in lung tissue, subsequently activating the formation of NETs through NADPH oxidase, facilitating the establishment of a premetastatic niche in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR357">357</xref>]. Leukotriene derived from neutrophils facilitates metastatic colonization through the selective expansion of highly tumorigenic cancer cell subpopulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR358">358</xref>]. Meanwhile, the cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol promotes tumor dissemination associated with a high-fat diet by increasing the count of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells at remote metastatic locations while decreasing the count of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR359">359</xref>]. Pathologically activated neutrophils, also known as polymorphonuclear MDSCs, overexpress fatty acid transport protein 2, which enables them to acquire immunosuppressive properties by taking up arachidonic acid and synthesizing PGE2, thereby playing a key role in promoting tumor metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR360">360</xref>].</p><p id="Par105">Neutral lipids also act as a key regulator for tumor metastasis.

Furthermore, neutrophils accumulate neutral lipids in response to lung mesenchymal cell stimulation during the pre-metastatic stage. Once breast cancer cells colonize the lungs, these lipid-rich neutrophils transfer their stored lipids to tumor cells, providing fuel for their survival and expansion, thus promoting metastatic colonization and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR362">362</xref>].</p><p id="Par106">Disseminated cancer cells, once they reach distant sites, typically enter a dormant state and must antagonize various suppressive cues, particularly thrombospondin-1 and bone morphogenetic proteins, to reactivate proliferative programs and achieve metastatic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR363">363</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR364">364</xref>]. Studies have revealed that stress hormones trigger neutrophils to secrete pro-inflammatory S100A8/A9 proteins, which further activate myeloperoxidase and cause the buildup of oxidized lipids in neutrophils. Upon release, these lipids activate fibroblast growth factor signaling cascades in dormant tumor cells, licensing dormancy exit and development into secondary neoplastic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR365">365</xref>]. Recent findings indicate that changes in immune modulation and metabolism can induce the reshaping of tumor-draining lymph nodes to form pre-metastatic niches. In the MMTV-PyMT mouse model, T cells, B cells, and fibroblastic reticular cells may adapt to the lymph node microenvironment by shifting their metabolism to FAO, thus providing energy for lymph node metastasis. The enhanced OXPHOS pathway in fibroblastic reticular cells within the tumor-draining lymph nodes, along with increased ATP utilization and TCA cycle metabolism, helps to generate a favorable niche that promotes tumor cell survival and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR366">366</xref>]. Extracellular vesicles secreted by melanoma enter the lymph nodes via the lymphatic vessels, prompting macrophages and endothelial cells in the lymph nodes to upregulate CD36 expression.

Tumor metastasis is a complex, multi-step process that involves dynamic interactions between tumor cells and immune cells, characterized by metabolic reprogramming. Elucidating these mechanisms may enable us to uncover novel therapeutic targets that interfere with the formation of pre-metastatic niches and halt the progression of tumor metastasis. In particular, intervention strategies targeting key metabolic and immune regulatory molecules such as CD36 and Cathepsin C may provide novel opportunities for preventing and managing cancer metastasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>The role of metabolic intervention in improving response to immunotherapy</title><p id="Par107">The discovery of the immune checkpoint marks an important milestone in cancer treatment research, providing entirely new targeting strategies for the treatment of tumors such as melanoma, stomach cancer, and lung cancer.

This process is crucial for balancing cellular metabolic activities under varying levels of oxygen, ensuring a steady supply of cellular energy and metabolic homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR427">427</xref>]. Furthermore, HIF-1 promotes the expression of key enzymes like PDHK1, thereby reinforcing the glycolytic pathway and enabling cells to generate energy more efficiently under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR428">428</xref>]. HIF-1 profoundly influences the phenotype and function of immune cells by regulating glycolytic pathway. For instance, in neutrophils, HIF-1&#x003b1; activation upregulates glycolytic metabolism, which is essential for sustaining cell survival, phagocytic capacity, and the formation of NETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR429">429</xref>]. In macrophages, HIF-1&#x003b1; tends to drive differentiation towards the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype rather than the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR430">430</xref>]. Additionally, HIF-1&#x003b1; significantly influences the migration, maturation and activation of DCs, with these processes being highly dependent on efficient glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR431">431</xref>]. In adaptive immunity, HIF-1&#x003b1; regulates the activation and fate determination of distinct T cell populations, including the development of cytotoxicity and memory properties in effector T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR429">429</xref>]. HIF-1&#x003b1; also affects B cell development, IgG class switching, and IL-10 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR429">429</xref>].</p><p id="Par114">The activation of HIF-1&#x003b1; is associated with various aspects of tumor progression, including angiogenesis, invasive tumor growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, pre-metastatic niche formation, and resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which correlate with poor patient prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR432">432</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR436">436</xref>]. Inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; has been shown to sensitize mouse tumors to ferroptosis inducers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR437">437</xref>]. Moreover, HIF-1&#x003b1; can upregulate PD-L1 expression on cancer cells, resulting in T cell exhaustion and impaired antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR438">438</xref>]. In preclinical models, combination therapy using HIF-1&#x003b1; inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 antibodies has demonstrated significant tumor growth suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR438">438</xref>]. The low-molecular-weight compound 32-134D potently suppresses HIF-1/2-mediated transcriptional activity, remodeling the TME by reducing the proportions of TAMs and MDSCs, while increasing infiltration of CD8&#x0207a; T cells and NK cells. Significantly, it synergizes with ICB, enhancing tumor eradication rates in murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR439">439</xref>]. In summary, HIF-1&#x003b1; exerts complex and multifaceted effects on the TME. It not only promotes tumor proliferation and drug resistance but also influences immune cell function through metabolic regulation. Therefore, targeting HIF-1&#x003b1; to inhibit tumor progression while preserving its supportive role for effector immune cells in hypoxic conditions is of critical importance. A promising therapeutic direction lies in exploring tumor-specific HIF pathway activation mechanisms, thereby enabling precision strategies that selectively inhibit the target within tumor cells while preserving immune cell functionality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Other immunometabolic checkpoints</title><p id="Par115">PPAR&#x003b1; belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor, playing an indispensable role in FAO, regulation of inflammatory responses, and cellular energy metabolism. Despite considerable debate over whether PPAR&#x003b1; acts as a tumor suppressor or oncogene, extensive research has confirmed its inhibitory effect on antitumor immune responses. Specifically, PPAR&#x003b1; can respond to fatty acids conveyed by tumor-derived exosomes, inducing excessive accumulation of lipid droplets and enhanced FAO in DCs, ultimately leading to immune dysfunction in DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR440">440</xref>]. Furthermore, the activation of PPAR&#x003b1; facilitates the development of Tregs and negatively regulates the production of IFN &#x003b3; in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NKT cells, further weakening immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR441">441</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR442">442</xref>]. In macrophages, PPAR&#x003b1; also holds significant importance. PPAR&#x003b1;- deficient bone marrow derived macrophages show upregulated expression of M1 macrophage-associated genes like IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, while the expression of the M2 macrophage marker gene arginase1 is downregulated, suggesting that PPAR&#x003b1; may influence the immune status within the TME by regulating macrophage polarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR443">443</xref>]. Given its unique position in metabolic reprogramming and modulation of immune cell function, PPAR&#x003b1; has arisen as an important immunometabolic checkpoint. By inhibiting PPAR&#x003b1; with antagonists, it is possible to impede the growth of cancer cells and restore the metabolic balance in immunosuppressive cells including M2-TAM, MDSCs, Tregs, and DCs, all of which have developed adaptations for FAO within the TME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR444">444</xref>]. TPST-1120, a specific PPAR&#x003b1; antagonist, is being evaluated in clinical trials for tumor treatment, both as a monotherapy and in combination with ICB, with the aim of achieving superior therapeutic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR445">445</xref>].</p><p id="Par116">As a nucleotidase widely expressed across various cells, CD73 converts extracellular AMP into adenosine, regulating local adenosine levels and activating the adenosine signaling pathway. This process induces significant immunosuppressive effects within the TME. Research indicates that CD73-adenosine pathway correlates strongly with unfavorable clinical outcomes in various solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR446">446</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR448">448</xref>]. Adenosine induces immune tolerance by binding to its corresponding receptors, particularly the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR). Specifically, adenosine inhibits the antitumor activity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, NK cells, DCs and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR449">449</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR451">451</xref>]. Additionally, adenosine promotes the activity of certain immunosuppressive cells including MDSCs and Tregs, further weakening the anticancer immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR452">452</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR453">453</xref>]. Currently, monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors targeting CD73 have been utilized in clinical trials and show potential for combination use with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, radiochemotherapy, and adoptive cell therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR454">454</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR457">457</xref>]. In summary, targeting the CD73/adenosine/A2AR axis represents a promising direction for future cancer therapies, offering new strategies to overcome tumor immune evasion and enhance treatment efficacy.</p><p id="Par117">CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is widely expressed across various cell types. It possesses dual enzymatic activities as an ADP-ribosyl cyclase and a cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) hydrolase, enabling it to convert NAD<sup>+</sup> into cADPR. cADPR functions as an essential second messenger in calcium signaling, significantly contributing to the regulation of intracellular calcium levels. Subsequently, cADPR can be further hydrolyzed into ADP-ribose and, through the action of additional enzymes, ultimately converted into adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR458">458</xref>]. CD38 not only inhibits the function of effector immune cells by producing adenosine, but also affects intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels through its NAD<sup>+</sup> cyclase activity. NAD<sup>+</sup> is a key cofactor in many metabolic pathways and is involved in processes such as mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis, and FAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR459">459</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR460">460</xref>]. In the TME, elevated CD38 expression may lead to increased consumption of NAD<sup>+</sup>, subsequently affecting energy metabolism and functional state of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR461">461</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR462">462</xref>]. Research indicates that T cells with reduced CD38 expression exhibit elevated NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, enhanced OXPHOS, increased glutaminolysis, and altered mitochondrial dynamics, which significantly improve tumor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR463">463</xref>]. Given the importance of CD38, researchers have developed various anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, like daratumumab and isatuximab. These antibodies exert immunomodulatory effects not only by eliminating CD38<sup>+</sup> Tregs, regulatory B cells, and MDSCs but also by directly inducing apoptosis and restoring antitumor immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR464">464</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR465">465</xref>]. Currently, there is growing interest in exploring CD38- focused treatments, particularly when paired with other immune checkpoint inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR462">462</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR466">466</xref>]. This combinational therapeutic strategy offers new insights and approaches for developing novel cancer immunotherapies, aiming to overcome the constraints of monotherapy and improve patient longevity and well-being.</p><p id="Par118">In summary, targeting immunometabolic checkpoints is expected to be a key direction for tumor treatment in future. We have compiled a list of clinical trials related to immunometabolic checkpoint to highlight the promising potential of these emerging targets (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The future of systemic interventions targeting immunometabolic checkpoints is expected to evolve toward greater precision and personalization. A key to achieving this goal lies in gaining a deep understanding of the differences in metabolic demands and pathway dependencies across various cell types, which can inform the design of cell-type-specific targeting strategies. In addition, many cell populations express distinct surface markers, providing a foundation for the development of targeted drug delivery systems. By leveraging technologies such as antibody-drug conjugates and nanocarrier-based drug delivery, it is anticipated that therapeutic agents will accumulate exclusively in target cells, thereby enhancing efficacy and reducing off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR467">467</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR470">470</xref>]. Furthermore, the rapid advancement of gene-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 also offers the possibility of precisely modulating immunometabolic checkpoint genes within specific cellular contexts. However, achieving clinical translation requires further research to characterize the inter-patient heterogeneity in metabolic states. This will help optimize patient stratification and identify reliable biomarkers for predicting which patients are most likely to benefit from therapies targeting specific immunometabolic checkpoints.</p><p id="Par119">

</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Applications of innovative technologies in immunometabolism</title><p id="Par122">In recent years, various cutting-edge technologies have infused new vitality into immunometabolism. For example, single-cell metabolomics helps decipher the metabolic states and understand the cellular heterogeneity of individual immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR471">471</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR472">472</xref>]. Researchers have developed the single-cell metabolic regulome profiling method, which quantifies proteins involved in metabolic pathways using high-dimensional antibody technology, successfully characterizing the metabolic features of cytotoxic T cells. By integrating multiplexed ion beam imaging time-of-flight mass spectrometry, they further unveiled the spatial distribution of metabolic programs within human tissues, demonstrating that metabolically compromised immune cells are excluded from the cancer-immune boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR473">473</xref>]. Additionally, Professor Theodore Alexandrov&#x02019;s team proposed an in situ single-cell metabolomics method based on Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-imaging mass spectrometry, which integrates fluorescence signals and morphological spatial features, achieving high-throughput, single-cell, in situ metabolic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR474">474</xref>]. This method allows the detection of over 100 metabolites per hour from 1,000 cells. Compared to static metabolomics, flux analysis techniques enable the dynamic exploration of metabolic activities and the tracking of metabolite flow within cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR475">475</xref>]. These techniques are widely applied to characterize metabolic reprogramming within the TME, providing insights into functional adaptations of immune cells therein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR476">476</xref>]. Furthermore, spatial metabolomics technology can dissect the spatial distribution of metabolites at the tissue or cellular level, map the metabolic landscape within the TME, and reveal the spatial heterogeneity of tumor metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR477">477</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR478">478</xref>]. This technology elucidates the metabolic symbiosis or competition between immune and tumor cells, providing guidance for metabolically targeted immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR479">479</xref>]. For example, the Single Cell Spatially resolved Metabolic technique integrates untargeted spatial metabolomics with targeted multiplexed protein imaging to analyze immune and cancer cells in human tissues at the single-cell level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR480">480</xref>]. The application of these technologies will provide a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of immunometabolism research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Discovery and validation of emerging biomarkers</title><p id="Par123">The discovery and validation of novel metabolic biomarkers represent one of the most important directions for future research. Metabolites, as potential biomarkers, can provide direct information about the TME, including the activity of immune cells, the metabolic demands of tumor cells, and the interactions between them. Lactate, adenosine, and PGE2 have become hotspots in research due to their effects in regulating immune cell functions and fostering immunosuppressive environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR481">481</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR483">483</xref>]. The success of immunotherapy is closely related to the metabolic characteristics of the TME. By analyzing the abundance of these specific metabolites, it is possible to predict patients&#x02019; potential responses to immunotherapy, thereby enabling personalized adjustments to treatment strategies, avoiding ineffective therapies, and improving treatment efficiency. Although some metabolites have shown potential as biomarkers, their clinical application must be preceded by large-scale, multicenter clinical validation. This not only requires the collection and analysis of a large number of patient samples but also standardized detection methods and rigorous statistical analysis to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the biomarkers. Combining metabolomics with other omics disciplines, including genomics and proteomics, offers a broader comprehensive biological perspective. This multidimensional data analysis helps to reveal complex metabolic networks and signaling pathways, identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and advance the development of precision medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR484">484</xref>]. Future research will focus more on discovering new metabolic biomarkers and elucidating their specific mechanisms in immune regulation. This requires the use of advanced technological platforms, such as high-throughput screening, machine learning, and big data integration, to process and analyze complex datasets, thereby accelerating the translation of laboratory discoveries into clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Metabolomics in personalized medicine</title><p id="Par124">Metabolomics holds great promise in the field of personalized medicine. It can identify specific metabolites associated with the onset and progression of tumors, which can serve as biomarkers to aid early diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR485">485</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR487">487</xref>]. The metabolic profile of tumors varies depending on factors such as tumor type, developmental stage, and microenvironment. Through metabolomics analysis, tumors can be classified more accurately, and this detailed classification can provide personalized treatment recommendations for cancer patients. Metabolomics can also be used to assess the metabolic responses of cancer patients during treatment. For example, during chemotherapy or targeted therapy, tumor cells may exhibit specific metabolic changes. By monitoring these changes, physicians can assess the treatment&#x02019;s effectiveness in real-time and adjust the treatment strategy accordingly, enabling more personalized and precise care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR488">488</xref>]. Moreover, metabolomics helps drive the development of targeted therapies based on tumor metabolic characteristics and can be combined with immunotherapy to improve therapeutic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR489">489</xref>]. Furthermore, metabolomics research supports the design of personalized nutritional interventions, such as adjusting diet and increasing physical activity to assist in cancer prevention and treatment, offering lifestyle-based interventions. Despite its immense potential in personalized medicine, the application of metabolomics faces several challenges. Standardization of metabolomics techniques and data quality control represent critical challenges that require attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR490">490</xref>]. The complexity of metabolic networks and the diversity of metabolites complicate data analysis. Additionally, translating metabolomics findings into clinical practice requires large-scale research validation. Looking ahead, with the continuous advancement of technology and the rapid development of artificial intelligence, metabolomics is expected to play a more significant role in cancer research and clinical practice, offering enhanced support for precise diagnosis, personalized treatment, and prognostic evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Metabolic state identification and key enzymes-targeting strategies</title><p id="Par125">Identification of the metabolic state of cells is crucial for understanding their functions and behaviors, unraveling tumor heterogeneity, discovering potential therapeutic targets, predicting treatment efficacy, and overcoming drug resistance. Traditionally, glycolysis has been considered a process occurring in the cytoplasm. However, recent studies have demonstrated that glycolytic enzymes are enriched in self-organized traveling waves on the plasma membrane, dynamically regulating local ATP production and correlating with cellular metastatic potential. This phenomenon may represent a mechanism aligning metabolic states with cellular behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR491">491</xref>]. Integrative multi-omics analyses demonstrate that OXPHOS-high cancer cells exhibit heightened dependence on mitochondrial respiration, ATP synthesis, and mitochondrial morphology regulation. Importantly, this dependency can be exacerbated by mutational backgrounds; for instance, phosphatase and tensin homolog-deficient cancer cells with high OXPHOS levels exhibit increased sensitivity to mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR492">492</xref>]. Based on this principle, a phase II clinical trial (NCT04945148) is currently evaluating the efficacy of metformin, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, in combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with tumors characterized by high levels of OXPHOS. Utilizing fluorescent biosensors, metabolomics analysis, and various imaging techniques, researchers have begun to investigate the dynamic changes in the metabolic states of cells at the single-cell level. For example, scratch assays have shown that upon release from density constraints, tumor cells transition from a low-glycolysis state to a high-glycolysis state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR493">493</xref>]. Such dynamic metabolic switching implies that fixed-schedule drug administration may fail to cover all metabolic subpopulations, whereas treatment strategies based on real-time metabolic monitoring could prove more effective. Although these technologies remain in the early stages of exploration, they represent a significant direction for the future development of precision oncological metabolic therapies.</p><p id="Par126">Reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment for therapeutic benefit hinges on the judicious selection of metabolic targets. Firstly, an ideal target should be a core regulator of the TME, capable of significantly restoring or reversing immune cell function upon intervention. For instance, IDO catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine, leading to tryptophan depletion and kynurenine accumulation. Reduced levels of tryptophan induce T cell exhaustion, while increased kynurenine promotes malignant behavior of tumor cells via the AHR pathway, enhances the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs and MDSCs, and impairs DCs antigen presentation capabilities, thereby suppressing antitumor immunity. Consequently, IDO constitutes a pivotal immunomodulatory hub within the TME. Despite challenges with monotherapy, strategies such as precision patient stratification (e.g., monitoring of kynurenine/tryptophan ratios), development of novel combination regimens (e.g., combining with immunotherapy, or dual IDO/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors), and optimization of delivery methods (e.g., in situ vaccines) provide significant breakthroughs for IDO-targeted therapy in cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR494">494</xref>]. Secondly, a major challenge in target selection lies in accurately identifying and leveraging the metabolic heterogeneity between tumor cells and immune cells. For example, glutamine blockade inhibits the energy metabolism of cancer cells, hindering their growth; conversely, effector T cells exhibit enhanced adaptability to glutamine antagonism, characterized by upregulated oxidative metabolism and heightened activation states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR495">495</xref>]. 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, a glutamine analogue, competitively inhibits critical enzymes such as glutaminase to block glutamine utilization. Its prodrug JHU083 is selectively activated to 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine within the TME, markedly attenuating systemic toxicity while retaining potent antitumor efficacy across multiple preclinical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR496">496</xref>]. Furthermore, targeting specific enzymes in metabolic pathways&#x02014;such as IDO, arginase, and glutaminase&#x02014;in combination with ICB can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME into an immunostimulatory one, thereby sensitizing tumors that were previously refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, advancements in single-cell and spatial omics technologies enable us to obtain detailed molecular profiles; AI-driven approaches are revolutionizing target discovery and drug design processes; and the application of nanotechnology allows for more precise drug delivery to targeted sites. The integration of these cutting-edge technologies promises to further advance the development of combined therapeutic strategies based on both metabolic and immune pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par127">In summary, immunometabolism, a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field, provides significant insights into the biological behaviors of tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion, laying a solid foundation to formulate more potent therapeutic strategies, particularly in combination with immunotherapy. This review systematically explores the metabolic adaptation of immune cells in the TME, analyzing the unique roles of key metabolic pathways, relevant metabolic enzymes, and three major classes of metabolites (glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids) in immune regulation. Additionally, this review delves into the complex metabolic interaction between tumor cells and immune cells and examines the role of immunometabolism in tumor metastasis. Compared to traditional immunotherapy strategies, targeting immunometabolism offers a novel perspective, revealing how metabolic interventions can enhance antitumor immune responses and pinpoint novel prospective targets for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. This article emphasizes that modulating immunometabolic checkpoints can enhance immune responses, reverse immunosuppression, and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In recent years, the development of innovative technologies such as single-cell metabolomics and spatial metabolomics has enabled researchers to deeply analyze the metabolic states of immune cells and their dynamic changes. Moreover, the discovery and validation of metabolic biomarkers provide new approaches for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy and adjusting treatment strategies in a personalized manner. The integration of metabolomics with other omics data, combined with high-throughput screening, machine learning, and big data analysis, is accelerating the transition from laboratory discoveries to therapeutic interventions. Future developments in immunometabolism will further advance precision medicine, providing more targeted strategies for personalized cancer
