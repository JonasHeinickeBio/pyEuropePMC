This new concept aids the immune system in identifying, attacking, and killing the tumor cells. However, although some encouraging results were observed clinically, this approach has its own limitations. For example, the benefits of certain anticancer drugs were only observed in some patients, off-target effects, immune evasion, and poor pharmacokinetics. Recently, several advancements have been made with the understanding and development of tumor-targeted drug delivery systems, which combine both effectiveness and patients&#x02019; safety during cancer treatment. In this review, we will focus on the latest progress in targeted drug delivery, particularly applying nanoparticles, liposomes, exosomes, and Wharton&#x02019;s jelly-derived macrovesicles as immune cell enhancers, as well as overcoming therapeutic resistance. We also characterize major current problems, such as the biocompatibility and scalability of the delivered engineering systems, as well as the required regulations. Lastly, we will show some examples of effective approaches to resolve these issues for more efficient cancer therapy. The importance of this article lies in bridging two sides in a single framework perspective: the novel implementation of unique delivery systems and the latest advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Thus, this provides better insights for the future of cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>cancer immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>drug delivery</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This research received no external funding.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Cancer is still among one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in 2022, almost 20 million new cancer cases were reported, and around 10 million deaths were related to cancer [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The number of cancer-related deaths is expected to increase in the future to reach around 15 million by 2040 [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cancer is a result of the abnormal proliferation of a particular type of cell in the body. We now have more than a hundred different types of cancer that have different behaviors and different responses to cancer drugs [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Although traditional cancer treatment approaches are showing some efficacy toward treating cancer patients, they are not always effective. Plus, drug-related adverse events have been reported with traditional cancer treatments [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various adjuvants are currently used in cancer immunotherapy to stimulate an antitumor reaction, which includes cytokines, checkpoint inhibitors, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Cancer immunotherapy approaches, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptides, adoptive cell transfer, tumor-infecting viruses, cytokines, checkpoint inhibitors, Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), and Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) agonists, have been developed to induce robust antitumor immune responses [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (This Ref from Dr.Nojoud Part). However, despite their potential effects, several considerable challenges seem to hinder their successful implementation.</p><p>The effectiveness of immunotherapy in treating cancer has been reported to be influenced by the tumor mutational burden (TMB). Higher levels of TMB indicate a greater number of mutations in cancer cells, which creates more neoantigens available for the immune system to recognize, leading to robust immune responses against the tumor and substantially improving the success of immunotherapy [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, cancer cells are not inherently immunogenic; they can escape natural immune detection and killing. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment can actively suppress the immune response, impacting the T lymphocytes&#x02019; effector function and leading to dysfunctional antitumor immune responses [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This allows the tumor to progress unchecked and enables it to grow to be clinically detectable, and it becomes more difficult for the immune system to eradicate the tumor. Tumor heterogeneity also complicates cancer therapy, resulting in uneven treatment responses and treatment failure in some cases. Moreover, the adaptability of cancer signaling networks allows tumor cells to develop multiple resistance mechanisms to various cancer therapies over time, posing a significant challenge to achieving long-lasting treatment success. Thus, ongoing development in immunotherapy strategies is required to achieve the desired treatment outcomes [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The use of nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative platform due to their ability to improve drug delivery, target specific tumor cells, and modulate the immune system [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These nanoparticles have a size that ranges between 5 and 200 nm and can accumulate in cancer cells through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lipid-based nanoparticles have been investigated for many decades and have long been the most common drug delivery system in cancer therapy. These particles have structural characteristics that are similar to those of the plasma membrane of cells, which contribute to their favorable safety, simplicity, biocompatibility, degradability, drug loading capacity, and low toxicity [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These particles can target tumor cells by either a passive or active mechanism. Passive targeting relies on the tumor&#x02019;s leaky vasculature with a pore size of 100&#x02013;800 nm, allowing the penetration and accumulation of these particles in tumor cells [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the other hand, active targeting focuses on functionalizing nanoparticles with ligands binding to specific receptors overexpressed on cancer cells to enhance specificity and selectivity. This can be achieved by decorating the surface of nanoparticles with tumor-specific ligands such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), peptides (RGD), folate, transferrin, and aptamers [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, nanoparticles can target immune cells, inducing a cascade of immune reactions and subsequently modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) to enhance antitumor immunity.</p><p>(Alhassan Odah) The use of nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy is growing enormously [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A number of scientists are currently focusing their research on understanding their biological systems and trying to understand and analyze their interaction with tumor cells to develop more successful anticancer drugs that can specifically target and kill tumor cells with no or minimal side effects [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-18-01086"><title>2. Overcoming Drug Resistance Mechanisms</title><p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of various cell types and other components, including immune cells, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix, all of which play a major role in tumor development, progression, and establishing resistance mechanisms to multiple anticancer drugs [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, developing targeted drug delivery systems might be a promising alternative for cancer treatment.</p><p>Although traditional cancer therapies, particularly chemotherapy, have proven to be effective against multiple tumors throughout the past years, extended exposure to these toxic agents could result in the development of a defense mechanism known as multidrug resistance (MDR), ultimately contributing to cancer progression and poor recovery [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Multiple cellular and physiological factors have been shown to contribute to the development of MDR, such as the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC), transporters like P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). All these factors play a critical role in hindering the efficacy of chemotherapy [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Plus, mutations or loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor gene can disrupt apoptosis and increase the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins like the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to the cellular factors, there are also physiological factors that can also directly contribute to the tumor growth, including the presence of tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs), which secrete protective cytokines and extracellular matrix components; high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), which impairs the antitumor drug penetration into the tumor; and finally, the acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which alters drug activity and uptake [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Advancements in nanotechnology may serve as a promising approach in improving the efficacy of chemotherapy. Results from multiple studies showed great potential in overcoming various MDR mechanisms. Below, we will discuss some of the nanotechnology approaches that have been developed and their applications in counteracting MDR pathways to eradicate tumors and enhance therapeutic outcomes.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086"><title>2.1. Targeted Drug Delivery to Tumor Hypoxia</title><p>Most solid tumor cells exist in a hypoxic microenvironment, which is considered a key contributor to chemotherapy resistance [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This oxygen-deficient microenvironment results from the rapid proliferation of tumor cells and the formation of irregular blood vessels. Since acidosis occurs in the absence of oxygen, modulating the hypoxic microenvironment and the acidity of the TME could inhibit chemotherapy drug resistance [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One approach that can be applied to mitigate tumor hypoxia is the specific delivery of oxygen ions into the tumor site by using nanocarriers. Parsad et al. developed a polyelectrolyte&#x02013;albumin complex coupled with MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (A-MnO<sub>2</sub> NPs) to attenuate hypoxia and acidosis in the TME; the study showed that the NP was able to generate O<sub>2</sub> by reacting with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under hypoxic conditions, while the pH within the tumor was increased from 6.7 to 7.2 [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. During the hypoxia process, the overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) (which is known to promote tumor cell growth) has been observed in different human cancers. Therefore, targeting HIF-1&#x003b1; could be a promising strategy to overcome hypoxia and to improve tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy [<xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Plus, it has been shown that the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) robustly blocks tumor cell progression by silencing the HIF-1&#x003b1;/CD73 axis. This can be achieved by using siRNA-loaded TAT-chitosan-SPION nanoparticles, which significantly reduced the expression levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; and CD73 in tumor cells (&#x0003c;25% compared to untreated cells), leading to decreased migration, proliferation, and tumor growth [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-pharmaceuticals-18-01086"><title>2.2. Targeted Delivery to Efflux Transporters</title><p>Efflux transporters belong to the mammalian adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters. They have been reported to play a key role in chemotherapy resistance [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. After the drug is internalized through the cell&#x02019;s plasma membrane, cellular transporters rapidly recognize and expel the drug out of the cell [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several transporters that contribute to chemotherapy resistance have been identified in humans, particularly P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is widely expressed in several MDR tumors [<xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Various strategies were employed to enhance drug availability by counteracting the effects of efflux transporter proteins, including the use of efflux pump inhibitors, drug modification to evade recognition, and encapsulation within nanocarriers to bypass transporter-mediated efflux. Therefore, multiple nanoparticles (NPs) were developed to specifically target cancer cells to bypass the cell membrane and to deliver the cargo to the cytoplasm away from the efflux pump [<xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, combination therapy has been proposed as a strategy to overcome MDR by co-delivering efflux pump inhibitors alongside chemotherapy [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, the delivery of miR495 using silica NPs was significantly more effective in overcoming MDR by downregulating P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, leading to an enhanced intracellular drug accumulation and significantly decreased MDR of lung cancer cells to doxorubicin (A549/DOX) to 38.5% compared to 80% survival when cells were treated with free doxorubicin [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, the co-delivery of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a P-gp inhibitor, with doxorubicin (DOX) significantly increased the cytotoxicity effect of DOX chemotherapy on MCF-7/ADR cell lines [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, in MCF-7/ADR tumor-bearing nude mice, nanoparticles demonstrated superior tumor-targeting capability and distribution, significantly increased tumor size reduction, and decreased COX-2 and P-glycoprotein expression in tumor tissues by less than 0.5-fold.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-pharmaceuticals-18-01086"><title>3. Harnessing Nanoparticles for Immune Cell Activation</title><p>Various immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, are recruited in the TME in response to the chemokines and cytokines that are secreted by the TME [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. When these cells become activated, they secrete various cytokines and chemokines [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, persistent activation of the immune cells and the inability to resolve the inflammatory response contribute to chronic inflammation. Thus, this facilitates tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Macrophages are one of the most active immune cells during tumorigenesis. These cells exhibit remarkable phenotypic and functional diversity in response to their surrounding environment, adopting either a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype or an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. M1 macrophages play a crucial role in enhancing tumor cell cytotoxicity, either directly by releasing cytotoxic molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), or indirectly by activating natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells through cytokine signaling (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;)) [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, M1 contributes to the activation of adaptive antitumor responses, particularly T cells, via antigen presentation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, such as IL-12 and TNF-&#x003b1;, to stimulate T-cell proliferation [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. TME is dominated by M2 macrophages, on the other hand, which suppress the efficacy of M1 cytotoxicity and promote tumor progression by secreting high levels of cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Several immunotherapeutic molecules were introduced to tackle tumor cells, including mAbs, small molecules, peptides, and proteins. However, the delivery of such therapeutic agents remains challenging due to the following reasons: poor targetability, permeability through cancer cells, and uptake by phagocytic cells [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. NPs hold a promising solution to overcome the aforementioned challenges [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, nanoparticles have been employed to selectively target and modulate TAMs, promoting their polarization from the M2 (protumor) to M1 (antitumor) phenotype. Several studies demonstrated that nanoparticles functionalized with mannose or hyaluronic acid (HA) can selectively bind to TAMs via the mannose receptor, triggering immune activation and enhancing the antitumor immune response. Song et al. developed mannose-modified (HA)-coated MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Man-HA-MnO<sub>2</sub> NPs) to target TAMs selectively. The study demonstrated that Man-HA-MnO<sub>2</sub> NPs significantly increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a marker of M1 macrophages, while reducing CD206, which is a marker for M2 macrophages [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In another study, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) showed their ability to directly induce the M1-like polarization of TAMs by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, Wang et al. developed IL-12-loaded poly (beta-amino ester) nanoparticles (IL-12@P1 NPs) designed specifically to reprogram TAMs in acidic TME conditions. In vitro, studies showed that IL-12@P1 NPs effectively converted M2-polarized RAW264.7 macrophages into the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies, on the other hand, demonstrated that IL-12@P1 NPs preferentially accumulated in the tumor, resulted in significantly enhanced antitumor immunity, and inhibited approximately 80% of tumor growth compared to the control groups that were treated with free IL-12, nanoparticles alone, or PBS [<xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><sec id="sec3dot1-pharmaceuticals-18-01086"><title>3.1.

These advanced delivery platforms ensure selective drug accumulation at tumor sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. This section discusses key innovations, particularly non-lipid-based nanoparticles, and their role in improving therapeutic outcomes.

Engineering Considerations for Optimized Drug Targeting</title><p>Advancements in nanotechnology have significantly transformed the landscape of cancer immunotherapy, mainly through the engineering of stimuli-responsive capabilities [<xref rid="B42-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

Liposomes have demonstrated significant promise in the field of immunotherapy for improving immunostimulatory drug distribution and optimizing therapeutic efficacy. PEGylated liposomes functionalized with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and anti-CD137, immunostimulatory agents that activate CTLs and NK cells, accumulated quickly towards the tumor, improved immune cell infiltration, and stimulated cytokine production [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The liposomal delivery system showed significant uptake of CPG and Poly(I:C) by the dendritic cells (DCs), with 2.5- and 5-fold increases, respectively, compared to unencapsulated ligands. When compared to the control group, the liposome formulation demonstrated a 75% tumor-free rate over 14 days and a significant reduction in tumor size [<xref rid="B159-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. In addition to surface functionalization, liposomes&#x02019; inherent properties can play a role in cell targeting. Positively charged liposomes have been shown to be able to target immune cells and stimulate an immunological response against tumors [<xref rid="B160-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. In a mouse model of colorectal cancer peritoneal metastases, a cationic DSTAP-liposome encapsulating resiquimod (R848), an aTLR7/8 agonist, produced a 4-fold increase in DCs, a 10-fold increase in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and a 5.2-fold increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. When compared to free R848, DSTAP-liposome encapsulation greatly increased antitumor activity, with a 60% survival rate over 150 days [<xref rid="B161-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. The formulation was further improved by incorporating R8 peptide and anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to enhance cellular targeting and boost the survival rate to 90% in a carcinomatosis mouse model [<xref rid="B162-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>].</p><p>Since cancer cells are able to suppress the activation of immune cells through the inhibitory immune checkpoint pathway, efforts have been made to effectively deliver a blockade to the TME [<xref rid="B163-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Notably, CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 are well-known inhibitory checkpoints and have been explored as an effective immunotherapy [<xref rid="B164-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4 that was approved by the FDA in 2011 for cancer treatment.

Additionally, attempts have been made to investigate PD-1 pathways via liposomes. Anti-PD-1 antibody was added to liposomes by Zhou et al., who then investigated the therapeutic effect in a mouse model. Due to improved liposome uptake in the tumor microenvironment, the liposomal group showed a longer survival rate and smaller tumor size than the free anti-PD-1 group across three tumor models (H22, 4T1, and CT26), with statistically significant differences (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref rid="B168-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>].

Fusogenic liposomes show a promising approach in delivering nucleic acids to cells. Mimicking the behavior of extracellular vesicles (EVs), these liposomes consist of anionic lipids that are able to fuse directly with cellular membranes and release their cargo into the cytosol [<xref rid="B175-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Stremersch et al. developed anionic fusogenic liposomes with cholesteryl hemisuccinate for siRNA delivery to the dendritic JAWSII cell line or H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma. The in vitro study demonstrated significant downregulation of the targeted gene by the liposomal delivery of siRNA in both cell lines compared to the free form [<xref rid="B176-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Lipoplex is another class of liposomes prepared by the electrostatic interaction achieved by the negatively charged nucleic acid and the pre-formulated cationic liposomes. Salomon et al. developed RNA-lipoplexes encoding CD4 neoantigen, demonstrating enhanced efficacy and remission in CT26 tumors in vivo [<xref rid="B177-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Similarly, Kranz et al. investigated the efficacy of antigen-encoding RNA-lipoplexes in inducing an IFN&#x003b1; response on T cells as an immunotherapy approach. The group further investigated the effect of charge on the targeting efficiency and immune response through the variation of lipid:RNA ratios. Particle accumulation shifted to the spleen as a result of a gradual decrease in cationic lipid concentration, where slightly negatively charged particles showed increased RNA expression in splenic cells [<xref rid="B178-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. While these advances in liposomes provide a promising platform for immunotherapy, issues including the immunogenicity of PEGylated liposomes and off-target effects still need to be resolved (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-01086-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2dot16-pharmaceuticals-18-01086"><title>3.2.16. Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs)</title><p>With the success of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-127 COVID-19 vaccines, LNPs have drawn a lot of interest as a drug delivery platform (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-18-01086-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) [<xref rid="B179-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. They demonstrated efficient antigen expression and triggered a strong immune response. LNPs are generally composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, PEG-lipids, and the encapsulated nucleic acids [<xref rid="B180-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>,<xref rid="B181-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. They shield nucleic acid from enzymatic degradation and deliver it to the targeted cells. Upon cellular uptake, LNPs can promote endosomal escape, allowing their cargo to be released into the cytoplasm for a therapeutic effect [<xref rid="B182-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. The integration of ionizable lipids into LNPs enables complexation with the negatively charged nucleic acids during synthesis at acidic pH, where the ionizable lipids become protonated. At physiological pH, the ionizable lipids are neutral, resulting in longer circulation time in plasma. However, when LNPs enter the endosomes upon cellular uptake, the acidic environment (~5.5&#x02013;6.0 pH) re-protonates the ionizable lipids, leading to membrane destabilization and cargo release in the cytosol [<xref rid="B183-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. The other components of LNPs, particularly phospholipids and cholesterol, provide structural integrity and stability. Additionally, PEG-lipids play a key role by initially increasing circulation time; however, the selection of the length and composition of the PEG chain dictates the appropriate time of dissociation from the particle surface [<xref rid="B184-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. Following systemic injection, PEG dissociation enables plasma protein adsorption on the LNP surface to engage with the targeted cell&#x02019;s specific receptor, facilitating effective internalization through receptor&#x02013;ligand interaction [<xref rid="B185-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. In cancer immunotherapy, LNPs can deliver siRNA or mRNA to reshape the TME by silencing immune checkpoints like PD-L1 or by inducing the expression of tumor-specific antigens. A study by Zhang et al. developed LNPs encapsulating mRNA encoding ovalbumin (OVA), a model antigen, to test the effect on the T-cell immune response. A library of ionizable lipids was established and tested with 12-carbon tail (12-C) lipid, demonstrating a significant mRNA translation and immune response resulting from an enhanced delivery to DCs. In addition to mRNA delivery and translation, 12-C lipid showed adjuvant properties through TLR-4 activation to also stimulate IL-12 cytokine production in DCs for antitumor efficacy [<xref rid="B186-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Similarly, Liu et al. examined the intratumoral administration of LNP delivering IL-12 and IL-27 mRNAs composed of synthesized ionizable lipid with di-amino groups (DAL). In a mouse melanoma model, the delivery of LNPs promoted the infiltration of immune cells such as NK and T cells into the tumor area, resulting in an approximately 3-fold inhibition of B16F10 melanoma growth compared to the untreated group [<xref rid="B187-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. In addition, LNPs encapsulating mRNA encoding an anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antibody, trastuzumab, were tested in a breast cancer model. The level of mRNA-translated trastuzumab antibody found in plasma was 64% higher compared to the injected trastuzumab over 30 days, even at a high dose of trastuzumab [<xref rid="B188-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. When tested in the HER2-positive model, mRNA-LNPs demonstrated significantly greater antitumor efficacy, with approximately a 4-fold reduction in tumor size compared to the HER2-negative mouse model [<xref rid="B188-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Moreover, the co-delivery of PD-L siRNA-LNPs and target antigen mRNA in monocyte-derived cells significantly increased antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses by 4.5-fold compared to the control siRNA-LNP DC group after two weeks of stimulation. By silencing both PD-L1/PD-L2 immune checkpoints and activating antigen-specific pathways, this dual delivery approach demonstrated stimulatory potential in enhancing ex vivo responses in translated cancer patients [<xref rid="B189-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Similarly, to boost mRNA-mediated immune responses for better cancer immunotherapy, Pam3 and OVA mRNAs co-delivered by LNPs stimulated TLR2/1 and TLR7/8 pathways, respectively [<xref rid="B189-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Furthermore, LNPs are utilized to deliver the next generation of cancer immunotherapy by encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs (single-guide RNAs) for targeted gene editing. Rosenblum et al. developed CRISPR-LNPs against PLK1 to explore the potential of therapeutic genome editing into aggressive orthotopic glioblastoma. The results showed a 30% increase in survival over the control group and up to 70% in vivo gene editing in glioblastoma.

Additionally, Wang et al. developed NLC co-delivering doxorubicin (Dox) and sorafenib (Sfn) for esophageal cancer therapy. NLCs were able to modulate the TME by reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and activating effector T cells, achieved by the delivery of Sfn.

In addition, gene editing can effectively change the behavior of the immune cells, enabling them to resist immunosuppressive signals and mount a more effective anticancer response [<xref rid="B263-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>].</p><p>Personalized medicine is progressively influencing the future of cancer treatments, highlighting patient-specific requirements for cancer treatment and their response to a particular drug. The advancement in omics sciences (e.g., genomics, proteomics) allows for the identification of unique biomarkers in tumors, which facilitates the development of personalized medicine. Furthermore, studies emphasizing the capability of bioengineered nanoparticles containing neoantigen vaccines to provoke strong immune responses will continue to grow; these types of vaccines are designed for a specific tumor characteristic, thus improving drug specificity and accelerating tumor eradication by the immune cells [<xref rid="B264-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>,<xref rid="B265-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. In addition, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis could facilitate the real-time monitoring of treatment responses and guide adaptive therapy strategies by revealing genetic mutations or changes in the tumor burden. This genomic information allows clinicians to tailor more effective treatment plans. For example, by identifying resistance mutations early, switching to more effective anticancer therapies, or adjusting drug dosages based on tumor evolution over time [<xref rid="B266-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly integral to enhancing nanomedicine design, formulation, and the prediction of therapeutic efficacy [<xref rid="B267-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. AI-driven computational models may swiftly assess extensive datasets to predict nanoparticle behavior, enhance drug loading efficiency, and customize nanoparticle surface characteristics for improved tumor targeting [<xref rid="B267-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Research has demonstrated that AI-based algorithms can identify optimal nanoparticle compositions for improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, reducing systemic toxicity while maximizing therapeutic accumulation within the TME [<xref rid="B268-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>,<xref rid="B269-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>]. Furthermore, utilizing AI-assisted tools for imaging and diagnostics can aid in the real-time monitoring of the administered drug and its treatment efficacy [<xref rid="B268-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>].</p><p>Multifunctional characteristics of the next generation of drug delivery devices will allow simultaneous therapy and diagnosis (theranostics). Smart nanocarriers can respond to tumor-specific cues, such as pH, redox gradients, hypoxia, or enzyme activity, to achieve on-demand drug release, enhanced tumor penetration, reduced systemic toxicity, and improved therapeutic efficacy by selectively targeting cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues [<xref rid="B270-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>]. Hybrid nanoparticles, such as liposome&#x02013;polymer conjugates and metal&#x02013;organic frameworks (MOFs), have demonstrated enhanced drug loading capacity with controlled and stimuli-responsive drug release. Additionally, MOFs improved biocompatibility and showed synergistic therapeutic effects in cancer treatment by enabling the co-delivery of multiple therapeutic agents with distinct mechanisms of action [<xref rid="B271-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>,<xref rid="B272-pharmaceuticals-18-01086" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>].

Nanoparticles are classified by composition into lipid-based (e.g., liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, niosomes), polymer-based (e.g., polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, dendrimers, hydrogels), and inorganic-based systems (e.g., gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, mesoporous silica, carbon allotropes). Key therapeutic modalities include chemonanotherapy, photothermal and photodynamic therapy, and nanovaccine delivery. Functional surface modifications such as hyaluronic acid (CD44-targeting) and iRGD peptides facilitate tumor-specific delivery, while therapeutic cargos span small-molecule chemotherapeutics (e.g., doxorubicin), nucleic acids (mRNA, siRNA, miRNA), immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines (IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;), tumor-associated antigens (e.g., HER2), genome-editing tools (CRISPR-Cas9), and neoantigen peptides (e.g., EGFR T790M).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pharmaceuticals-18-01086-sch001" position="float"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="pharmaceuticals-18-01086-t002"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">pharmaceuticals-18-01086-t002_Table 2</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Advantages and limitations of lipid-based nanoparticle delivery systems.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Delivery System</th><th align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Advantages</th><th align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Limitations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Liposomes</td><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
