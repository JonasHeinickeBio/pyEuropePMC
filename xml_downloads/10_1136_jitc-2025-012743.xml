Myeloid cells are frequently found in the tumor microenvironment and their infiltration correlates with survival and response to treatment. High myeloid infiltration is typically a poor prognostic factor, and the immune suppressive and prometastatic roles of myeloid cells are well established. However, there is an increasing appreciation of the antitumor functions performed by myeloid cells, which include direct tumor cell killing, phagocytosis, antigen presentation and T and natural killer cell recruitment. Moreover, advances in immune phenotyping have uncovered myeloid subsets with positive prognostic significance, including subsets correlating with higher response rates to immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent progress in mapping and dissecting the opposing effects of myeloid cells on cancer progression and immunotherapy response. The overall impact of myeloid cells is context-dependent, and combination therapies are needed to leverage the antitumor potential of these cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Myeloid</kwd><kwd>Myeloid-derived suppressor cell - MDSC</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>Macrophage</kwd><kwd>Neutrophil</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source>

Immune suppression is largely the net result of inadequate T cell activation that is driven by the local tumor microenvironment (TME). Myeloid cells, which include macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can inhibit antitumor responses and promote tumor progression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). However, myeloid cells can also play pivotal roles in stimulating a proinflammatory microenvironment. Advances in our understanding of the complexities of myeloid cell biology reveal new mechanisms that contribute to strong antitumor immune responses.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Positive and negative roles of myeloid cells in cancer. Myeloid cells can either promote or inhibit tumor growth. Antitumor functions performed by myeloid cells include direct tumor cell killing by monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils through production of lytic factors, such as complement, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species; phagocytosis; antigen presentation; and T and NK cell recruitment. Myeloid cells also can promote tumor progression by inhibiting T-cell and NK function activity through mechanisms such as expression of immune checkpoint ligands, including PD-L1, TIM-3 and VISTA, and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;.
