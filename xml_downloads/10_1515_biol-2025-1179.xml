This review provides a comprehensive picture of modern approaches to immunotherapy-based treatment strategies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor T cells, mRNA vaccines, and biomaterials-based platforms, with a focus on their translational value and application to precision medicine. Emerging insights into the tumor microenvironment, immune resistance mechanisms, and T-cell subpopulation dynamics (e.g., &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, exhausted CD8&#x0207a; T cells) are analyzed to elucidate immunotherapy response variability. Biomaterials such as injectable scaffolds, nanogels, and artificial antigen-presenting cells enable localized and sustained immune modulation, improving delivery precision and therapeutic efficacy. Personalized approaches, including neoantigen vaccine development and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted biomarker prediction, are rapidly advancing individualized treatment regimens. Clinical trials illustrate how combination strategies with ICIs, chemotherapy, and nanomedicine enhance patient survival. Despite challenges including immune-related adverse events, manufacturing complexity, and global access disparities, integration of AI and multi-omics platforms promises to optimize patient stratification and therapeutic outcomes. This evolving paradigm positions personalized immunotherapy at the forefront of future oncologic care.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>

Unlike chemotherapy or radiation, which directly attacks cancer cells, immunotherapy works by boosting the body&#x02019;s natural immune system to fight the cancer. Cancer immunotherapy (CIT) includes various strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, all aimed at counteracting the tumor&#x02019;s ability to evade immune detection [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The immune system is vital for health because it identifies and destroys defective cells within the body. However, various strategies employed by cancer cells for escape include giving out signals that suppress the immune system or building an environment that suppresses the immune system. Immunotherapy seeks to overcome these drawbacks and, therefore, is a revolutionary treatment method in oncology [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>One of the most successful immunotherapeutic strategies involves checkpoint inhibition. Molecules like programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) normally act as brakes to prevent overactivation of the immune system [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These inhibitors have proved useful in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung cancer, and other cancers. As an example, pembrolizumab and nivolumab have manifested higher survival in patients with previously incurable cancers [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CIT is mainly designed to boost the activity of cytotoxic T cells (HLA class I), rather than helper T cells (HLA class II). However, recent studies show that CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells also play a crucial role in fighting tumors [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has functional versatility, which makes these cells develop into subgroups, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the level of Th1, it stimulates cytotoxic activity and secretion of interferon-gamma to improve anti-tumor effects [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while Tregs may diminish immune response and form an immunosuppressive environment within the tumor [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This bivalency situates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as an attractive therapeutic avenue in next-generation immunotherapies [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Another strength of immunotherapy lies in its selectivity &#x02013; it typically targets cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissues. Targeted therapies include endocrine therapy, molecular targeted therapy, and monoclonal antibodies like trastuzumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Likewise, bispecific antibodies bind to cancer cells and immune effector cells, enhancing immunosuppressive activity against tumor [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another factor that makes immunotherapy a potential therapy for cancer and other diseases is its synergistic potential with other therapies. The use of immunotherapy in combination with either chemotherapy [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or radiation boosts the general effectiveness as cancer is treated through multiple approaches. For instance, the integration of radiation therapy with immunotherapy enhances the destruction of tumor cells and diminishes the immune system&#x02019;s ability to shield the tumor from destruction [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, research has surveyed approaches for improving the concordance of these pairs in order to boost the efficacy of the interventions [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These combination strategies have been found to prevent the failure of single-agent therapies and enhance the survival of patients with recalcitrant cancers [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Among emerging modalities, CAR T-cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient&#x02019;s T cells to target specific cancer antigens and has shown remarkable efficacy in hematologic malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the same way, oncolytic anti-tumor selective viruses are being genetically developed to destroy cancer cells and trigger immunity [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. New investigations also point to the synergism of CAR T therapy and oncolytic virotherapy to enhance efficient treatment strategies [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>To improve efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity, localized delivery of immunotherapies is gaining attention. Interventional radiology allows the local administration of immunomodulators to malignant neoplasms. They have given encouraging outcomes in early trials and are expected in carcinomas that are unresponsive to systemic treatments [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Advancements like hydrogel delivery systems and implantable scaffolds supplement the idea of localized immunotherapy by providing long-term release and action [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These techniques are growing progressively to overcome impediments resulting from resistant tumors, offering new avenues to curing the disease [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Immunotherapy, on the other hand, has been more successful in recent years despite certain difficulties. Challenges like immune-related side effects, drug resistance, as well as high costs are still major [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Also, deciding on the optimal dose and searching for biomarkers that would indicate patient response are two areas of interest for the treatment method. Nevertheless, all those complications make the future of immunotherapy look rather bright. Due to the continuous scientific activities, new ways and techniques will be developed, such as personalized immunotherapy and other new cellular therapies, and global patients&#x02019; prognosis will be better and have an increased number of treatments. The change that immunotherapy has brought means that this type of treatment will be central to cancer treatment in the future.</p><p>Given the rapid evolution of immunotherapy and its transformative impact on cancer treatment, there is a need to consolidate current knowledge and identify future directions. This review presents both established and emerging immunotherapy strategies &#x02013; including ICIs, CAR T-cells, and mRNA-based cancer vaccines &#x02013; while also addressing delivery platforms, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted modeling, and resistance in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Emphasis is placed on clinical translation and predictive approaches to ensure immunotherapy remains central to modern oncology.</p></sec><sec id="j_biol-2025-1179_s_002"><label>2</label><title>Overview of the TME</title><sec id="j_biol-2025-1179_s_002_s_001"><label>2.1</label><title>Immune cycle and its four stages in tumor immunity</title><p>Immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach to intervene in the body&#x02019;s immune system with the help of modulators or drugs, which mainly stimulate the body&#x02019;s immune response to kill cancer cells during the treatment process [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The immune cycle in tumor immunity can be broadly divided into four interconnected stages: pre-phase (early stage), mid-phase, mid-late phase, and late phase. These stages collectively describe the process by which the immune system identifies, targets, and eliminates cancer cells. Each phase has distinct events that contribute to the overall anti-tumor immune response, forming the basis for many modern immunotherapies.</p><p>During the pre-phase (early phase), tumor antigens are shed off by cancer cells due to either apoptosis or necrosis. These antigen presenting cells (APCs), namely, the dendritic cells (DCs), which then digest them and present them by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on the surface of the naive T cells, despite the fact that a T-cell receptor (TCR) with an antigen-MHC, special signals are needed for the activation of the T-cells. This is the foundational step targeted by cancer vaccines and ICIs to enhance T-cell priming and antigen recognition [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The mid-phase involves the trafficking of activated T cells toward the TME. This is facilitated under the direction of chemokine gradients, for instance, in CXCL9 and CXCL10. When in the TME, T cells lodge in the endothelium and bind to the cancer cell and recognize tumor antigens presented on the latter through MHC molecules. The engagement of TCRs on T cells with neoantigenic complexes guarantees the selective destruction of cancerous cells. Cytotoxic T cells then induce the apoptosis of cancer cells through such actions as granzyme and perforin-mediated activities. This stage emphasizes the need to traffic T-cells into the tumor; this aspect is helped by some immunotherapies such as ICIs (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4), engineered CAR T cell therapies expressing CXCR3, VEGF inhibitors that normalize tumor vasculature, and chemokine-modulating therapies like nanomaterials enhancing CXCL9 expression. These approaches have been shown to improve T-cell infiltration and enhance anti-tumor immunity [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>During the mid-late phase, the cycle becomes endogenous; that is, the elements that constitute the cycle become continuous and independent. Immune mediated death of tumor cells releases more tumor antigens into the TME as a result of the anti-tumor immune response. Again, these antigens are picked up by the APCs, which boost the immune response by attracting more and more effector T cells. However, this phase is also accompanied by immunosuppressive mechanisms, including the use of Tregs and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In the last period, the immune response against cancer cells is initiated and continued vigorously. Memory T cells generated in earlier stages play a pivotal role in maintaining long-term immune surveillance. These cells maintain the specificity of the primary immune response and are quickly responsive in case of tumor recurrence. Sustained tumor antigen release and continued effector T cell activation result in persistent anti-tumor immunity. <xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_fig_001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> displays this cancer immunity cycle and essential steps through which T cells mediate anti-tumor responses.</p><fig position="float" id="j_biol-2025-1179_fig_001" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cancer-immunity cycle depicting the essential steps through which T cells mediate anti-tumor responses. The process begins with the trafficking of T cells to tumor sites via the bloodstream (Step 1), guided by chemokine gradients that facilitate their infiltration into the TME (Step 2). Upon arrival, T cells recognize tumor cells through specific interactions with antigen-MHC complexes (Step 3), leading to the targeted killing of cancer cells (Step 4). This cytotoxic activity results in the release of tumor-associated antigens (Step 5), which are subsequently captured and processed by DCs (Step 6). These APCs prime and activate naive T cells by presenting tumor antigens via MHC molecules and delivering co-stimulatory signals (Step 7), thus initiating a new cycle of immune activation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="j_biol-2025-1179-fig001" specific-use="teaser-image" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="j_biol-2025-1179_s_002_s_002"><label>2.2</label><title>Molecular mechanisms of immune therapy resistance</title><p>Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care by attacking tumors using both cellular and molecular immune responses, and the TME has emerged as an important target of therapeutic response [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, resistance mechanisms, both intrinsic and extrinsic, remain a significant challenge [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Tumors can release suppressor cytokines or metabolites and recruit immunosuppressive cells like Tregs and N2 neutrophils. Consequently, treatments such as ICIs also affect cytokine signaling, which can be overcome by tumor-related immune escape [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Some of the key resistance mechanisms, as demonstrated in <xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_fig_002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, include the MDSC influence on the release of factors such as reactive nitroxide intermediates, ARG1, and interleukin 10, an action which inhibits T-cell activation and prevents the tumor cells from immune mediated cell death [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Similarly, Tregs and signaling molecules like TGF-&#x003b2; enhance immune suppression by modulating signaling pathways, including the Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, contributing to a highly immunosuppressive TME [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="j_biol-2025-1179_fig_002" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Illustration of the immunosuppressive mechanisms within the TME that contribute to immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy.

Simultaneously, N1 neutrophils, under the influence of TGF-&#x003b2; and associated signaling pathways, contribute to immune response inhibition. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) further suppress cytotoxic T cell activity by engaging immune checkpoints and altering signaling pathways such as PD-L1, which is often overexpressed on tumor cells to evade immune destruction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="j_biol-2025-1179-fig002" position="float"/></fig><p>Research by Leko and Rosenberg identified different types of tumor antigen recognition mediated by T lymphocytes and explored their clinical safety and efficacy in targeted immunotherapy [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Their results imply that enhancing access to antigenic therapy may increase the therapeutic capacity of immunotherapy in cancer patients. Additionally, Zhao et al. demonstrated that activating ferritin decarboxylase could reduce drug resistance in conventional cancer therapy by regulating metabolic pathways and signaling involving iron desiccation [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Despite these advancements, resistance remains a significant limitation.

Furthermore, these scaffolds may be used for the controlled release of immunomodulatory agents <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic> that engage and stimulate immune cells onsite inside tumors. These implantable biomaterials also have specific release characteristics or kinetic profiles in order to sustain the therapeutic impact. New developments have investigated the incorporation of 3D printing and biotic materials in order to improve the structural and functional properties of such support structures [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Injectable scaffolds provide a more minimally invasive method of delivering immunotherapy. These can be prepared as hydrogels or microparticles and can be directly implanted into the desired site for drug delivery, where the system, upon implantation, undergoes self-assembly or gelation to form a reservoir for the drug. In particular, injectable biomaterials have been proven to be practical for metastatic cancers and for regions that are difficult to operate on. In this way, they can secrete cytokines or ICIs to remodulate the immune context of tumors [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, the injectable scaffolds can be administered with any concentration and can easily accommodate combination therapy.

It is possible to design such systems to only respond to certain biological signals, thus enabling the delivery of therapeutic agents to occur based on changes within the microenvironment.

Liposomes and polymersomes as synthetic nanoparticles can be designed and coated with tumor antigens or immune modulating agents to give high immune response signals. Also, the use of biologically derived nanocarriers such as extracellular vesicles has been considered owing to their inherent biocompatibility and immune-associated functions [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Nanoparticles act to encapsulate immunotherapeutic agents, including antigens, adjuvants, or immune modulators, in order to enhance their stability and have slow-release properties. For example, nanoparticulate based vaccination offers more efficient antigen deposition and presentation, with resultant improvement in immune response in cancer immunotherapies [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, lipid based nanoparticles, gold nanorods, and mesoporous silica nanoparticles have also been used for enhancing the DC uptake, which is crucial for the activation of the immune system [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, in recent years, nanocarrier-based biomedicine has made significant progress in cancer therapy.

This study concluded that nanogels had better application potential for immunotherapy. As a three-dimensional crosslinked aqueous material, nanogels are structurally stable, have a large specific surface area, and can better target particular immune cell subpopulations or immunological organs, which boosts the drug&#x02019;s bioavailability. Additionally, fewer adverse events are produced by its slower release impact. Zhang and Pu proposed to combine fusion nanomedicines with immunotherapy and discussed tumor immunotherapy under molecular and nanoengineering approaches [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This study concluded that activatable nano-formulations could produce immunotherapeutic effects on TME under internal and external stimuli and reduce the incidence of immune-related adverse events.

The adaptability of nanoparticle-based systems allows for the integration of multiple therapeutic functionalities.

paradigm of tumor treatment. Among them, T-cell antigen specificity has been shown to have a link to tumor phenotype. The utilization of T-cell subsets is discussed to be important for elucidating the anti-tumor cellular mechanisms of immunotherapy and guiding treatment regimens [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. T-cell serves as the most potent effector cells in the anti-tumor immune response. In current CIT, T-cells are mainly used to achieve interventions from both ICIs and overt cell therapy. Chow et al. analyzed the immunobiology of T-cell exhaustion and noted its correlation with tumor control. They emphasized that targeting exhaustion pathways could significantly enhance immunotherapy efficacy [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. T-cell-based immunotherapy has become an effective therapeutic strategy for anti-tumor therapy in addition to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Based on the differences in cell receptor expression, T-cells can be classified into two subpopulations, &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T. Mensurado et al. concluded that current &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T-C are more dependent on MHC-mediated and neoantigen expression, which limits their applicability. In contrast, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-C were less dependent on neoantigen loading and MHC antigens due to their unique tissue orientation, allowing them to have better anti-tumor activity. The study of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cell subsets could provide a reference value for cancer prognostic intervention and therapeutic strategy development [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. <xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_fig_003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the regulatory mechanism of tumor-promoting &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-C.</p><fig position="float" id="j_biol-2025-1179_fig_003" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Regulatory mechanism of tumor promoting gamma delta T-C.

As part of CIT strategies, AI has progressively become a key component, potentially providing transformational methods of enhancing treatment precision, outcome prediction, and personalized treatment. AI algorithms, notably machine learning, have been applied to define biomarkers that show treatment effectiveness, such as PD-L1 expression levels and Tumor Mutation Burden. These biomarkers assist in determining the chances of a patient&#x02019;s response towards immunotherapy. Works referring to Xie et al. reveal how imaging omics can be used to investigate tumor heterogeneity with regard to immunotherapy response and biomarker expression [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. AI plays an important role in differentiating patients about their responsiveness to immunotherapy using large datasets such as genomics and imaging data.

One of the most pressing barriers is the manufacturing complexity, particularly for personalized therapies like CAR T-cells and individualized neoantigen vaccines. CAR T therapy involves <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> genetic modification of a patient&#x02019;s own T-cells, a process that takes 2&#x02013;3 weeks and requires highly controlled good manufacturing practice environments. This time lag is problematic in aggressive cancers where rapid progression outpaces therapy preparation. Conversely, neoantigen vaccines, such as mRNA-4157 and CV9202, continue to mandate labor-intensive antigen identification, peptide synthesis, and formulations with turnaround times extending to more than 1 month, and thus are non-viable in clinical settings [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. AI tools themselves, as computation pipeline technologies accelerate prediction, even though the framework requires timely tumor exome sequencing and HLA typings that are not equally accessible in healthcare environments. Workflows are also often delayed by data bottlenecks and inconsistency of sample quality, which do not allow their timely integration with the therapeutic decision-making [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>].</p><p>Regulatory pathways remain unclear for many neoantigen-based therapies. Whereas ICIs and CAR T-cells have made it through regulatory approval with standardized clinical measures (e.g., ORR, PFS), neoantigen vaccines and AI-predicted epitope treatments have no normalized surrogate measures and population-wide clinical trial design. In principle, phase III designs are not easily affected by personalized vaccine trials owing to the lack of sample size and standardization. Regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and drug administration and the European Medicines Agency require both regulation and scalability, which are both overstretched in high-personalized mutanome and immune profiling-driven therapies. Moreover, there is also the problem of interpretability of AI-based tools, which establishes a bottleneck for clinical validation. These models often operate as &#x0201c;black boxes,&#x0201d; challenging traditional regulatory frameworks that require explainable outputs, especially when integrated into diagnostics or companion decision tools [<xref rid="j_biol-2025-1179_ref_191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. The economic burden of immunotherapy remains one of the most well-documented obstacles to widespread use.</p><p>Global disparities in immunotherapy access remain stark. Access to CAR T and ICIs is mostly available in high-income markets, whereas limited infrastructure and funding exist in low- and middle-income countries to conduct clinical trials and provide delivery systems. Furthermore, racial and ethnic minorities are not well-represented in clinical trials, distorting efficacy and toxicity data. To bridge this gap, strategies such as global licensing, public-private manufacturing partnerships, and regional regulatory harmonization are essential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="j_biol-2025-1179_s_003"><label>3</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Advances in personalized medicine, particularly in the realm of CIT, signify a transformative era in oncology. Immunotherapy has brought innovative strategies for cancer treatment by stimulating the human immune system to resist tumors. While it demonstrates promising application effects, it is not without certain defects and limitations. This study analyzed recent advances and the current status of immunotherapy research, emphasizing emerging tools such as nanomedicine formulations that provide targeted cancer therapies. The use of T-cell subsets, novel antigen expression methods, and the development of interventions targeting the TME hold significant potential. Neoadjuvant ICI blockades and combined immunotherapeutic approaches further enhance anti-tumor efficacy. Additionally, the integration of AI into CIT marks a critical leap forward. Innovations in deep learning, NLP, and federated learning are expected to expand the scope of biomarker discovery and predictive modeling. AI&#x02019;s role in clinical workflows will likely accelerate personalized therapeutic decisions while reducing the time and costs associated with drug development and clinical trials.</p><p>Future research must prioritize individualized detection and management, the rapid development of new technologies and vaccines targeting novel antigens, the reduction of side effects, and the mitigation of immunotherapy-associated drug resistance. Looking ahead, the convergence of personalized medicine, immunotherapy, and AI offers a transformative potential to revolutionize cancer treatment. Through continued innovation and efforts to address existing challenges, this multidisciplinary approach promises not only improved patient outcomes but also a future where cancer care is highly efficient, targeted, and accessible for all.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="j_biol-2025-1179_fn_001" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
