However, the delivery of STING agonists alone has some limitations, such as easy degradation and low bioavailability. Moreover, STING agonists are usually injected intratumorally to avoid systemic side effects caused by strong immune responses, which is not suitable for metastatic lesions. Using nanocarriers to deliver STING agonists can overcome these limitations to some extent. This review explores the collaborative foundation between nanodelivery systems and the STING signaling pathway. It systematically summarizes the existing types of STING agonists and the types of nanoscale delivery systems and analyzes the delivery strategies of STING agonist delivery systems from multiple aspects, including the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor cell targeting, multifunctional integrated drug delivery systems, and novel biomaterial. The review elaborates on the practical applications of these strategies as well as the challenges and problems they face. Finally, it analyzes and discusses the potential future directions of STING nanodelivery systems, aiming to provide references for research in related fields and to promote the efficient application of STING agonists in cancer therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p>

These treatment methods have achieved significant progress in tumor therapy, but still have certain limitations. For example, compared with traditional treatment methods, immunotherapy has milder side effects, but it can cause the immune system to become overly active, causing damage to normal tissues.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Immunotherapy works by removing the &#x0201c;constraints&#x0201d; of the host immune system on cancer cells. But this process may stimulate the immune system to misidentify and attack normal cells and tissues, thereby causing adverse reactions.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The infiltration of immune cells in solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Targeted drug delivery offers several benefits in tumor treatment, including improved permeability, the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, minimized side effects, and accurate targeting of tumor cells.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Improved permeability refers to Nanoparticles boost drug passage through biological membranes, aiding in reaching target sites. The EPR effect refers to the phenomenon in solid tumors where large molecules or nanoparticles enter tumor tissue via leaky blood vessels and stay there due to poor lymphatic drainage. However, during targeted therapy, cancer cells may evade the suppression of drugs through genomic alterations, changes in signaling pathways, and other means, leading to drug resistance.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hence, it remains highly challenging to design and develop more advanced methods for tumor treatment.</p><p>The superior performance of STING pathway in tumor treatment has made it a novel method for tumor therapy. Activating STING pathway can boost the development of dendritic cells (DC) and enhance antigen presentation, which in turn initiates T cell-mediated immune reactions.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, the use of STING agonists in tumor therapy are rarely stemming from their poor stability and rapid clearance. Nanoparticle delivery systems can encapsulate STING agonists, significantly improving their stability, bioavailability, and cellular uptake efficiency. Moreover, nanoparticle delivery systems can precisely deliver STING agonists to tumor sites, achieving targeted drug delivery and reducing side effects on normal tissues.</p><p>In this review, we summarize the existing types of STING agonists, the types of nanoscale delivery systems and analyze the strategies and challenges of STING agonist delivery systems in terms of TME, tumor cell targeting, multifunctional integrated drug delivery systems, and novel biomaterials. We also analyze and predict the future development directions based on the current research status and challenges.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>STING Signaling Pathway: A Powerful Target for Tumor Immunotherapy</title><p>STING is a crucial immunoregulatory protein that acts as a pivotal component in innate immune responses. STING is composed of 379 amino acids,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> STING consists of five parts: four transmembrane helices in the N-terminal transmembrane domain (NTD), namely TM1 (residues 21&#x02013;41), TM2 (47&#x02013;67), TM3 (87&#x02013;106), and TM4 (116&#x02013;136), as well as a globular C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 157&#x02013;379).<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The N-terminal transmembrane region anchors STING to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane or the membranes of other organelles.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> CTD, which is exposed in the cytoplasm, contains a ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a C-terminal tail (CTT).<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> LBD interacts with cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), which is responsible for converting intracellular double-stranded DNA into the second messenger 2&#x000b4;,3&#x000b4;-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), thereby activating STING. In the reSTING state of the cell, the dimerized conformation of STING predominantly resides within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane system.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Upon stimulation, the STING protein initiates intracellular translocation, beginning its journey from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane system and subsequently progressing toward the Golgi, facilitated by the coat protein complex II.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The structure of STING enables it to sense DNA that abnormally exists within cells. Pharmaceutical agents designed to target genomic material induce structural DNA lesions in the cytoplasmic compartment of malignant cells.

The approach of delivering STING agonists via nanodelivery systems has brought a new direction to tumor treatment. Nanodelivery systems for STING agonists can not only overcome the problems of poor stability and rapid clearance of STING agonists, but also precisely deliver STING agonists to tumor sites, achieving targeted drug delivery and reducing side effects on normal tissues.</p><p>The synergistic approach of nanodelivery systems and the STING signaling pathway has shown significant advantages in tumor treatment. In this review, we explored and analyzed the design strategies of several types of drug delivery systems for STING agonists. Nanotechnology was used to effectively increase the accumulation of STING agonists at tumor sites, while the activation of the STING signaling pathway enhanced the antitumor immune response. However, the existing drug delivery systems all have certain limitations. For example, nanocarrier materials may have potential toxicity and side effects, the synergistic mechanisms between STING agonists and other drugs in combination therapy are not fully understood, and the stability of nanocarriers is difficult to ensure. Future research needs to explore new therapeutic strategies to overcome these limitations.</p><p>In summary, we hope that these strategies will not only bring new hope to cancer patients but also provide new ideas and orientations for the future vision of overcoming cancer challenges and offer some forward-looking guidance for subsequent research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Youth Scientific Research Fund Project of Liaoning University (grant numbers LDZDJC2401).</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s0008"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>No data was used for the research described in the article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0009"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Hsu</surname>
